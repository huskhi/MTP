  We propose a Hamiltonian formalism for a generalizedFriedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology model in the presence of both a variableequation of state (EOS) parameter $w(a)$ and a variable cosmological constant$\Lambda(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. This Hamiltonian system containing1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as theequation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable massobject moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of thescale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constantmass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\Lambda$cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology correspondsto a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take intoaccount the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantizedstraightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of theWheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.
  We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited statesof the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods ofDiagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable theapproximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary timesand perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We presentexact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral functionand optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlichpolaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, andinteracting with phonons hole in the t-J model.
  In this paper, we describe a new, systematic and explicit way ofapproximating solutions of mixed hyperbolic systems with constant coefficientssatisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition via different Penalizationapproaches.
  We present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901/902 superclusterfrom the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts inthe range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independentclassifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared tolocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surfacemass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high localgalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-densityrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and localprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to thenearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is moreimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown ofthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in thegalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of redgalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry fromCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passivegalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescriptionof Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describesan intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformedinto S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.
  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis toinvestigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of AtomicWeights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Functionand Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in themechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of theatomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. Wealso investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regimecould superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasingmass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The mostinteresting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class ofself-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillatingvalues indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process ofincreasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities areidentified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinearmethods is further required.
  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new chargedgauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Suchparticles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. Inthis paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ couplinghelicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discoverychannel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, providesthe best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requiresintegrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeVand provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. Thishelicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of variousdiscovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interferenceregime, but with higher integrated luminosities.
  We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography onsize-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface.Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigatedwith dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined withsub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting,the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterizedby the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling,and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transformingnanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation atpremelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistenceduring photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization,where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degreeof structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend onthe size of nanoparticle.
  A rotating, two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to exhibitvortices of multiple quantization, which are possible due to the interatomicinteractions between the two species. Also, persistent currents are absent inthis system. Finally, the order parameter has a very simple structure for arange of angular momenta.
  We investigate a one-parameter family of probability densities (related tothe Pareto distribution, which describes many natural phenomena) where theCramer-Rao inequality provides no information.
  Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to theirpotential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronicapplications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemicalcells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplersand optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results ofinvestigations into the use of thermal treatment of poly(p-phenylene vinylene)(PPV) films grown on a variety of substrates (quartz and glass). Filmthickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range oftechniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method,Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.
  Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Lawconstitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the restframe of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used todemonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of themeasured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper'and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic timedilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications.A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the ReciprocityPrinciple as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out
  In the present work we investigate the main differences in the lead neutronskin thickness, binding energy, surface energy and density profiles obtainedwith two different density dependent relativistic hadronic models, within theThomas-Fermi approximation. We show that the asymmetry parameter for lowmomentum transfer polarized electron scattering is not sensitive to the modelparametrization differences.
  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with ageestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observationsof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Ourspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitoredsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS withinthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with aperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period ofthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teffvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlationbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude therotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of thelong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-masscompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radialvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the hoststar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, whichlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discoveryaround the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debrisdisks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.
  In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant spacedefined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and giveexplicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point ofthe torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization ofan open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell isequal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations ofthe Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point),and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms ofthe reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximalcoordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts aboutthe Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These canbe viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to makethe presentation more self-contained.
  We determine the quantum phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard modelwith bond-charge interaction X in addition to the usual Coulomb repulsion U athalf-filling. For large enough X and positive U the model shows three phases.For large U the system is in the spin-density wave phase already known in theusual Hubbard model. As U decreases, there is first a spin transition to aspontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase and then a charge transition toa novel phase in which the dominant correlations at large distances correspondto an incommensurate singlet superconductor.
  We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinantsand permanents of positive semi-definite matrices. We use the hafnianinequality to improve the lower bound of R\'ev\'esz and Sarantopoulos on thenorm of a product of linear functionals on a real Euclidean space (this subjectis sometimes called the `real linear polarization constant' problem).
  The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics ofradiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented.Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boilingpoint (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long-term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structuredspectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visibleluminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificialopals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated withdifferent nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced andthe spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface isbeing changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on theCu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species ofthe liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the sameas in opal matrixes.
  We have studied Zn(CN)2 at high pressure using Raman spectroscopy, and reportGruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigenvectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of theobserved phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modesexhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the softphonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit,with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapiddisordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.
  Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixedsingular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solutionis an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally.The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI,Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces,resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraicdifferential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classifyall finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.
  Based on overall experimental observations, especially the pair processes, Ideveloped a model structure of the vacuum along with a basic-particle formationscheme begun in 2000 (with collaborator P-I Johansson). The model consists inthat the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons,consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ ofzero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with aCoulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005)and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easieraccessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a correspondingquantitative determination of the vacuuon size.
  We give general spectral and eigenvalue perturbation bounds for a selfadjointoperator perturbed in the sense of the pseudo-Friedrichs extension. We alsogive several generalisations of the aforementioned extension. The spectralbounds for finite eigenvalues are obtained by using analyticity andmonotonicity properties (rather than variational principles) and they aregeneral enough to include eigenvalues in gaps of the essential spectrum.
  We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing fornon-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvatureand isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-rollparameters. We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature andisocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end ofinflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recentlyproposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affectsignificantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end ofinflation.
  We present photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic observations ofUSco160611.9-193532 AB, a candidate ultrawide (~1600 AU), low-mass (M_tot~0.4M_sun) multiple system in the nearby OB association Upper Scorpius. We concludethat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we alsopresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself aclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, thesystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which haveunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.However, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely onprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separationrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows thatthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-massassociation members will be separated in projection by <15", so analysis of thewide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for allwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess atthe 98% confidence level.
  Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photonsemitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantumproperties of light require sources for which either individual photons, orpairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research onsingle-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantumdot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generatingindistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using suchstructures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-likesemiconductor devices for quantum light generation.
  We show that the number of renewals up to time $t$ exhibits distributionalfluctuations as $t\to\infty$ if the underlying lifetimes increase at anexponential rate in a distributional sense. This provides a probabilisticexplanation for the asymptotics of insertion depth in random trees generated bya bit-comparison strategy from uniform input; we also obtain a representationfor the resulting family of limit laws along subsequences. Our approach canalso be used to obtain rates of convergence.
  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about xand y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probabilitydensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whosekernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is basedupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental informationand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while theexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The differencebetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number ofdata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and thetrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and theredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable numberof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutualinformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of thevariables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information isused to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of theintroduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomlyrelated variables.
  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariantrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\itinelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields andtheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of theinelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaonpotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbativeapproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent resultsshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As aconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We concludethat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclearequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, itsisovector sector.
  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 andNovember 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and theXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it oneof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infraredtelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. InJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in opticaland X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it iscomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. InNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescentstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to theJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overallwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days orhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed onmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long termvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation aunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions areinterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within ajet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation dependson the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).
  We report the experimental realization and tomographic analysis of novelquantum light states obtained by exciting a classical thermal field by a singlephoton. Such states, although completely incoherent, possess a tunable degreeof quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental testsome of the criteria proposed for the proof and the measurement of statenon-classicality. The quantum character of the states is also given in quantuminformation terms by evaluating the amount of entanglement that they canproduce.
  We show that the conditions which originate the spin and pseudospinsymmetries in the Dirac equation are the same that produce equivalent energyspectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vectorand scalar potentials. The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapesof the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. Whenboth scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions forisospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the uppercomponent or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making itequivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angularmomentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper orlower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a fewpossible applications of this result.
  Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due toquark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studiedsystematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelasticscattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$,twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibitthe Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluonbremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluonscattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times theratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification isnot negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. Themodifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquarkannihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquarkdistributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark andantiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitativelyexplains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadronsuppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquarkannihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in thelarge fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jetquenching in heavy-ion collisions.
  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by asource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. Oneof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-inducedvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristicvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Datafor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 arepresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in thiscompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDVthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in thevariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored theflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25mUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine thevariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes ofthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropicannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation isin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adoptinga simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequencydependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of thescattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. Thelatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.
  We investigate several Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) and Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions. Wemeasure $\gamma$-ray production from Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions that can be asignificant background for double-beta decay experiments which use lead as amassive inner shield. Particularly worrisome for Ge-based double-beta decayexperiments are the 2041-keV and 3062-keV $\gamma$ rays produced viaPb$(n,n'\gamma$). The former is very close to the ^{76}Ge double-beta decayendpoint energy and the latter has a double escape peak energy near theendpoint. Excitation $\gamma$-ray lines from Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions arealso observed. We consider the contribution of such backgrounds and theirimpact on the sensitivity of next-generation searches for neutrinolessdouble-beta decay using enriched germanium detectors.
  A new estimation of the gamma-ray flux that we expect to detect from SUSYdark matter annihilation from the Draco dSph is presented using the DM densityprofiles compatible with the latest observations. This calculation takes alsointo account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of thetelescope. We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe andinterpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects todetect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST.
  We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429(characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandrasatellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plusblackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keVluminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energychanneled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar andallow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of acompact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from thesource and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of theX-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.
  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), anapproach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry andrepresentation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called theflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (thelower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, tothe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of thefundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraicgeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxedforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In thisarticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing thatthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction ofthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematicalpositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positiveformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structuralconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. Theseturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of theKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of thecanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantumgroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemannhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemannhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.
  The left-right twin Higgs(LRTH) model predicts the existence of the chargedHiggs $\phi^{\pm}$. In this paper, we study the production of the charged Higgsboson $\phi^{-}$ with single top quark via the process $bg\to t\phi^{-}$ at the$CERN$ Large Hadron Collider(LHC). The numerical results show that theproduction cross section can reach the level of $10 pb$ in the reasonableparameter space of the LRTH model. We expect that, as long as it is not tooheavy, the possible signatures of the heavy charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$might be detected via the decay mode $\phi^{-}\to \bar{t}b$ at the LHCexperiments.
  We present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the effect ofnuclear spin on the performance of optical lattice clocks. With a state-mixingtheory including spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, we describe the originof the $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition and the differential g-factor betweenthe two clock states for alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, using $^{87}$Sr as anexample. Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields arediscussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. Anexperimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr isperformed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensorlight shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specificmeasurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as amethod to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.
  We probe turbulence structure from centimetric to metric scales bysimultaneous imagery at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths at the VLTtelescope and show that it departs significantly from the commonly usedKolmogorov model. The data can be fitted by the von Karman model with an outerscale of the order of 30 m and we see clear signs of the phase structurefunction saturation across the 8-m VLT aperture. The image quality improves inthe infrared faster than the standard lambda^{-1/5} scaling and may bediffraction-limited at 30-m apertures even without adaptive optics atwavelengths longer than 8 micron.
  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and thespherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found thatthese phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surfacemodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature modelby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and notwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons arecomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form acompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices oftriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, aninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength insidethe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phasesmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bendingrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and thefluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.
  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelengthmonitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energydistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, withflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the veryhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jetmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during ourmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproducethe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff valuefor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth dueto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of thehigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presenceof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important rolein the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close tothe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray andgamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Comptonemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectralvariability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresispatterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-daytime scales.
  We consider maximum solution $g(t)$, $t\in [0, +\infty)$, to the normalizedRicci flow. Among other things, we prove that, if $(M, \omega) $ is a smoothcompact symplectic 4-manifold such that $b_2^+(M)>1$ and let$g(t),t\in[0,\infty)$, be a solution to (1.3) on $M$ whose Ricci curvaturesatisfies that $|\text{Ric}(g(t))|\leq 3$ and additionally $\chi(M)=3 \tau(M)>0$, then there exists an $m\in \mathbb{N}$, and a sequence of points$\{x_{j,k}\in M\}$, $j=1, ..., m$, satisfying that, by passing to asubsequence, $$(M, g(t_{k}+t), x_{1,k},..., x_{m,k})\stackrel{d_{GH}}\longrightarrow (\coprod_{j=1}^m N_j, g_{\infty},x_{1,\infty}, ...,, x_{m,\infty}),$$ $t\in [0, \infty)$, in the $m$-pointedGromov-Hausdorff sense for any sequence $t_{k}\longrightarrow \infty$, where$(N_{j}, g_{\infty})$, $j=1,..., m$, are complete complex hyperbolic orbifoldsof complex dimension 2 with at most finitely many isolated orbifold points.Moreover, the convergence is $C^{\infty}$ in the non-singular part of$\coprod_1^m N_{j}$ and$\text{Vol}_{g_{0}}(M)=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\text{Vol}_{g_{\infty}}(N_{j})$, where$\chi(M)$ (resp. $\tau(M)$) is the Euler characteristic (resp. signature) of$M$.
  A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) ispresented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and severalinteresting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functionsassociated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, andReiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the gradingby matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that themorphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and thatdecomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrorsthe decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to theHilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.
  Recent observational and theoretical advances concerning astronomical masersin star forming regions are reviewed. Major masing species are consideredindividually and in combination. Key results are summarized with emphasis onpresent science and future prospects.
  Context. Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma RayBursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminateaccurate light curves rapidly.  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray lightcurves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expectedof published data, but automatically created and updated so as to beself-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite ofprograms which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effectsof the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up areappropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, asnecessary for a fading source.  Results. The light curve repository website(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios anddeep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs aredetected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the dataarriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.
  For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use anintegrated set of methods and tools to describe specifications and designs, andalso to perform analyses such as dependability, schedulability and performance.AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient forsoftware architecture modeling. In addition, AADL was designed to accommodateseveral types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-drivenapproach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a smallexample. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows thegeneration of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models tosupport the analysis of software and system architectures, in criticalapplication domains.
  Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscaleobjects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field-emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electroncharging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric fieldresponsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of thecurrent-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by ametallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for acylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.
  In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology anddifferential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and thecyclic bar complex.
  We compute the loss of power in likelihood ratio tests when we test theoriginal parameter of a probability density extended by the first Lehmannalternative.
  A polynomial skew product of C^2 is a map of the form f(z,w) = (p(z),q(z,w)), where p and q are polynomials, such that f is regular of degree d >=2. For polynomial maps of C, hyperbolicity is equivalent to the condition thatthe closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further,critical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. Forpolynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f isAxiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from theright analog of the Julia set. Here we present the analogous conclusion:critical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set.In addition, we construct new examples of Axiom A maps demonstrating variouspostcritical behaviors.
  A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide astatistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses andorbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs toall the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types ofplanets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provideresults on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those withshort lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to aspace-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Othermethods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensivestatistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planetsthat a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planetsensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity ofthe Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identifyand determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority ofplanets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey islikely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the natureof planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation andhabitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is anexample of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish theseobjectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under theNASA Discovery Program cost cap.
  A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additiveenergy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on thestatistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additivemulti-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spinchain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptoticalexpressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for thelimiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are foundto be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).
  We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field suchthat the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to thevector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite.In particular, it follows that complete shrinking Ricci solitons and completesmooth metric measure spaces with a positive lower bound on the Bakry-Emerytensor have finite fundamental group. The method of proof is to generalizearguments of Garcia-Rio and Fernandez-Lopez in the compact case.
  We report studies of cyclotron resonance in monolayer graphene. Cyclotronresonance is detected using the photoconductive response of the sample forseveral different Landau level occupancies. The experiments measure an electronvelocity at the K- (Dirac) point of $c_{K}^{*}$ = 1.093 x 10$^{6}$ ms$^{-1}$and in addition detect a significant asymmetry between the electron and holebands, leading to a difference in the electron and hole velocities of 5% byenergies of 125 meV away from the Dirac point.
  We consider the density of two-dimensional critical percolation clusters,constrained to touch one or both boundaries, in infinite strips, half-infinitestrips, and squares, as well as several related quantities for the infinitestrip. Our theoretical results follow from conformal field theory, and arecompared with high-precision numerical simulation. For example, we show thatthe density of clusters touching both boundaries of an infinite strip of unitwidth (i.e. crossing clusters) is proportional to $(\sin \piy)^{-5/48}\{[\cos(\pi y/2)]^{1/3} +[\sin (\pi y/2)]^{1/3}-1\}$.  We also determine numerically contours for the density of clusters crossingsquares and long rectangles with open boundaries on the sides, and compare withtheory for the density along an edge.
  From the mass term for the transformed quark fields, we obtain effectivecontact interactions of the NJL type. The parameters of the model that maps asystem of non-interacting transformed fields into quarks interacting via NJLcontact terms are discussed.
  Let $X$ be an equivariant embedding of a connected reductive group $G$ overan algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic. Let $B$ denote aBorel subgroup of $G$. A $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ is a subvariety of theform $\diag(G) \cdot V$, where $V$ is a $B \times B$-orbit closure in $X$. Inthe case where $X$ is the wonderful compactification of a group of adjointtype, the $G$-Schubert varieties are the closures of Lusztig's $G$-stablepieces. We prove that $X$ admits a Frobenius splitting which is compatible withall $G$-Schubert varieties. Moreover, when $X$ is smooth, projective andtoroidal, then any $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ admits a stable Frobeniussplitting along an ample divisors. Although this indicates that $G$-Schubertvarieties have nice singularities we present an example of a non-normal$G$-Schubert variety in the wonderful compactification of a group of type$G_2$. Finally we also extend the Frobenius splitting results to the moregeneral class of $\mathcal R$-Schubert varieties.
  Thermodynamic stable interaction pair potentials which are not of the form``positive function + real continuous function of positive type'' are presentedin dimension one. Construction of such a potential in dimension two issketched. These constructions use only elementary calculations. Themathematical background is discussed separately.
  We introduce a new class of canonical AZD's (called the supercanonical AZD's)on the canonical bundles of smooth projective varieties with pseudoeffectivecanonical classes. We study the variation of the supercanonical AZD$\hat{h}_{can}$ under projective deformations and give a new proof of theinvariance of plurigenera.
  We present spectra for 33 previously unclassified white dwarf systemsbrighter than V = 17 primarily in the southern hemisphere. Of these newsystems, 26 are DA, 4 are DC, 2 are DZ, and 1 is DQ. We suspect three of thesesystems are unresolved double degenerates. We obtained VRI photometry for these33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometricparallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, weconverted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energydistribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. purehydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates ofeffective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems areestimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizonsof 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarfsample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these20 systems.  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.Using the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able toconstrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object ismost likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool whitedwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrareddue to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.
  We map noncommutative (NC) U(1) gauge theory on R^d_C X R^{2n}_{NC} to U(N ->\infty) Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C, where R^d_C is a d-dimensional commutativespacetime while R^{2n}_{NC} is a 2n-dimensional NC space. The resulting U(N)Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C is equivalent to that obtained by the dimensionalreduction of (d+2n)-dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills theory onto R^d_C. We show thatthe gauge-Higgs system (A_\mu,\Phi^a) in the U(N -> \infty) Yang-Mills theoryon R^d_C leads to an emergent geometry in the (d+2n)-dimensional spacetimewhose metric was determined by Ward a long time ago. In particular, the10-dimensional gravity for d=4 and n=3 corresponds to the emergent geometryarising from the 4-dimensional N=4 vector multiplet in the AdS/CFT duality. Wefurther elucidate the emergent gravity by showing that the gauge-Higgs system(A_\mu,\Phi^a) in half-BPS configurations describes self-dual Einstein gravity.
  Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasingcomplexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with noveltechniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lotof attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systemscan be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausalsystems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that thesystem predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. Anembedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Ourmethod aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability andautonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of thisarchitecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.
  An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter,so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) thetheoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surfacebrightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for theGalactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updatedsample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect -Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) weconclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper isnot useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe withunknown distances.
  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstonevector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). Tothis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with thenonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed isconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generatorsnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously brokenas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only onegenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosonsrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangementof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remainstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theoryinvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turnout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gaugeinvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation couldbecome directly observable at low energies.
  A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions isconstructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mappingthem to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relationsamong spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is notequipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between thesesystems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties oftwistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practicalapplications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics.Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. Aunifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) inthe massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying thedualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur inhigh spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds aswell as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paperwe present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details.
  Orthogonality criterion is used to shown in a very simple and general waythat anomalous bound-state solutions for the Coulomb potential (hydrino states)do not exist as bona fide solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger, Klein-Gordon andDirac equations.
  Photon splitting due to vacuum polarization in a laser field is considered.Using an operator technique, we derive the amplitudes for arbitrary strength,spectral content and polarization of the laser field. The case of amonochromatic circularly polarized laser field is studied in detail and theamplitudes are obtained as three-fold integrals. The asymptotic behavior of theamplitudes for various limits of interest are investigated also in the case ofa linearly polarized laser field. Using the obtained results, the possibilityof experimental observation of the process is discussed.
  Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral$D$ mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phasedifference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixingparameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivityof the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-IIIexperiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurementsof the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phasedifference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ thresholdwith CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.
  The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads tomanifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in purespinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate theseintegrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loopand two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramondstates.
  We consider an interaction-driven scenario for the two-dimensionalmetal-insulator transition in zero magnetic field (2D-MIT), based on meltingthe Wigner crystal through vacancy-interstitial pair formation. We show thatthe transition from the Wigner-Mott insulator to a heavy Fermi liquid emergesas an instability to self-doping, resembling conceptually the solid to normalliquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explainsmany puzzling features of the 2D-MIT.
  We find a necessary and sufficient condition for a compact 7-manifold toadmit a $\tilde G_2$-structure. As a result we find a sufficient condition foran open 7-manifold to admit a closed 3-form of $\tilde G_2$-type.
  In this topical review I revisit the "chromospheric flare." This shouldcurrently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out thepossiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone,but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It isthe source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular thevisible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to thecoronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand thepropagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in thechromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presentsseveral difficult and interesting physical problems.
  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution ofprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angularmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration ofoutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implicationsfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weakionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be ableto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisationequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the diskmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic couplingby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing theconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains havegrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fieldscan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions aregenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions whileelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of themagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers havea combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregatedto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains haveaggregated to 1 micron in size.
  We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual basedmodel that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim isto show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuummodels predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays welldefined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by thediscrete nature of the interacting agents.
  We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic materialusing state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method.To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, whereSrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valencestates (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Tisubstitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in thecalculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finitegap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appearsat the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spinstates contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallicferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ticoncentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneckto achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicityin ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-basedtechnology.
  We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in themerging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments.We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.{\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with atotal mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can movewith V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the "bullet" X-ray gas can move withV_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that areaccelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time evenwithout the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end ofthe error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gaswould not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models withV_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Ourresults are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model ofAngus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter$M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.
  We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalarcurvature type" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now considerthe case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector ofthe superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of theweight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principalorbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has atmost 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to thesuperpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersiontype metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\"ahler-Einstein product.
  In this paper, we investigate the properties of a membrane in the M5-branebackground. Through solving the classical equations of motion of the membrane,we can understand the classical dynamics of the membrane in this background.
  We discuss dynamics of a slow quantum phase transition in a spin-1Bose-Einstein condensate. We determine analytically the scaling properties ofthe system magnetization and verify them with numerical simulations in a onedimensional model.
  With the help of a masslike function which has dimension of energy and equalsto the Misner-Sharp mass at the apparent horizon, we show that the first law ofthermodynamics of the apparent horizon $dE=T_AdS_A$ can be derived from theFriedmann equation in various theories of gravity, including the Einstein,Lovelock, nonlinear, and scalar-tensor theories. This result strongly suggeststhat the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics of the apparenthorizon and the Friedmann equation is not just a simple coincidence, but rathera more profound physical connection.
  We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSSStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at highGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-likebehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.
  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequenciesand wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically inlimits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results areverified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range ofinhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density fieldleads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, incomparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. Thisfrequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as faras the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersionrelations and wave profiles are important for potential observations oftorsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral linewidths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for adevelopment of coronal seismology.
  Systems of strongly correlated fermions on certain geometrically frustratedlattices at particular filling factors support excitations with fractionalcharges $\pm e/2$. We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lyingexcitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numericaldiagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, thecriss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order.Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probablyleading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, thequasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of thefractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, wefine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges aremanifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeperunderstanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numericaladvantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.
  The classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients C(lambda,mu,nu) carry anatural $S_3$ symmetry via permutation of the indices. Our "carton rule" forcomputing these numbers transparently and uniformly explains these sixsymmetries; previously formulated Littlewood-Richardson rules manifest at mostthree of the six.
  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principlestheory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably wellaccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy frompure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphiteinterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersiveinteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waalsdensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. Theuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystalparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite andpotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as bindingseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus arereported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies arereported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocalapproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
  The Colin de Verdi\`ere number $\mu(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum corankof a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix for $G$ (that is, of a Schr\"odinger operatoron $G$ with a single negative eigenvalue). In 2001, Lov\'asz gave aconstruction that associated to every convex 3-polytope a Colin de Verdi\`erematrix of corank 3 for its 1-skeleton.  We generalize the Lov\'asz construction to higher dimensions by interpretingit as minus the Hessian matrix of the volume of the polar dual. As a corollary,$\mu(G) \ge d$ if $G$ is the 1-skeleton of a convex $d$-polytope.  Determination of the signature of the Hessian of the volume is based on thesecond Minkowski inequality for mixed volumes and on Bol's condition forequality.
  We study quivers with relations given by non-commutative analogs of Jacobianideals in the complete path algebra. This framework allows us to give arepresentation-theoretic interpretation of quiver mutations at arbitraryvertices. This gives a far-reaching generalization ofBernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functors. The motivations for this workcome from several sources: superpotentials in physics, Calabi-Yau algebras,cluster algebras.
  We apply mirror symmetry to the problem of counting holomorphic rationalcurves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. As we found inPart A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3contains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as itscovering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X isself-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, wederive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. Inparticular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends onthe torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that thethreefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange oftorsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.
  In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete DipoleApproximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much largerthan the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publiclyavailable DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipolesrequired for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering byspheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory.Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generallyincrease with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational timesincrease steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on acluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer programis the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster ofcomputers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very largeparticles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Currentlimitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.

  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory inspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property thespace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of fieldconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all thepp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for thebackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorialfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shellpp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universalsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive tothe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such resultscan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We alsostudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). Inparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transversespace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinitionrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massivemodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of thissimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified onthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, aniterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFTequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analysescan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.
  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for theformation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the mainpredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamicalperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify theevolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory requirebetter KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadlyconsistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantialcollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are importantproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroidssuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identificationof more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provideadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding anddynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivatecalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation andevolution.
  Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental andbifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group andobtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gaugesinglets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describethe intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stablenonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory withfundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c')gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.
  We derive correlation coefficients between temperature and line-of-sightvelocity as a function of optical depth throughout the solar photosphere forthe non-magnetic photosphere and a small area of enhanced magnetic activity.The maximum anticorrelation of about -0.6 between temperature and line-of-sightvelocity in the non-magnetic photosphere occurs at log tau5 = -0.4. Themagnetic field is another decorrelating factor along with 5-min oscillationsand seeing.
  We provide a description of the interpolating and sampling sequences on aspace of holomorphic functions with a uniform growth restriction defined onfinite Riemann surfaces.
  The final state interactions (FSI) model in which soft rescattering of lowmass intermediate states dominates is suggested. It explains why the stronginteraction phases are large in the $B_d\to\pi\pi$ channel and are considerablysmaller in the $B_d\to\rho\rho$ one. Direct CP asymmetries of $B_d\to\pi\pi$decays which are determined by FSI phases are considered as well.
  Starting from the reduced dynamical model of a two-junction quantuminterference device, a quantum analog of the system has been exhibited, inorder to extend the well known properties of this device to the quantum regime.By finding eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator, thepersistent currents flowing in the ring have been obtained. The resultingquantum analog of the overdamped two-junction quantum interference device canbe seen as a supercurrent qubit operating in the limit of negligiblecapacitance and finite inductance.
  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks areinvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formedin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strengthimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is theon-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in thisprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprisesmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution ischaracterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the smallclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronizationbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number ofsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration andseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statisticalproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the fewactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, areindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcationtypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additionalunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to somereal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in theunsynchronizable state.
  We investigate the evolution of the electronic structure in SrRu_(1-x)Ti_xO_3as a function of x using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy, whereSrRuO3 is a weakly correlated metal and SrTiO3 is a band insulator. The surfacespectra exhibit a metal-insulator transition at x = 0.5 by opening up a softgap. A hard gap appears at higher x values consistent with the transportproperties. In contrast, the bulk spectra reveal a pseudogap at the Fermilevel, and unusual evolution exhibiting an apparent broadening of the coherentfeature and subsequent decrease in intensity of the lower Hubbard band with theincrease in x. Interestingly, the first principle approaches are found to besufficient to capture anomalous evolutions at high energy scale. Analysis ofthe spectral lineshape indicates strong interplay between disorder and electroncorrelation in the electronic properties of this system.
  Associated to the classical Weyl groups, we introduce the notion ofdegenerate spin affine Hecke algebras and affine Hecke-Clifford algebras. Forthese algebras, we establish the PBW properties, formulate the intertwiners,and describe the centers. We further develop connections of these algebras withthe usual degenerate (i.e. graded) affine Hecke algebras of Lusztig byintroducing a notion of degenerate covering affine Hecke algebras.
  A recent result of Balandraud shows that for every subset S of an abeliangroup G, there exists a non trivial subgroup H such that |TS| <= |T|+|S|-2holds only if the stabilizer of TS contains H. Notice that Kneser's Theoremsays only that the stabilizer of TS must be a non-zero subgroup.  This strong form of Kneser's theorem follows from some nice properties of acertain poset investigated by Balandraud. We consider an analogous poset fornonabelian groups and, by using classical tools from Additive Number Theory,extend some of the above results. In particular we obtain short proofs ofBalandraud's results in the abelian case.
  We study the question of whether a composite structure of elementaryparticles, with a length scale $1/\Lambda$, can leave observable effects ofnon-locality and causality violation at higher energies (but $\lesssim\Lambda$). We formulate a model-independent approach based onBogoliubov-Shirkov formulation of causality. We analyze the relation betweenthe fundamental theory (of finer constituents) and the derived theory (ofcomposite particles). We assume that the fundamental theory is causal andformulate a condition which must be fulfilled for the derived theory to becausal. We analyze the condition and exhibit possibilities which fulfil andwhich violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violatingamplitudes can arise.
  Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensorproduct of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations ofG, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a nonzero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in itskernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors forsome triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and theyalmost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most1.
  There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryonsin the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave,D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. Aftercomparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data,we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmedbaryons observed recently.
  We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps withsingularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. Wenext study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a givenmanifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions.
  We studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality onelectron-phonon (e-p) interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either onsuspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates, at sub-Kelvintemperatures. The power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured usingsensitive normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) tunnel junctionthermometers. Membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used toclearly see the onset of the effects of two-dimensional (2D) phonon system. Weobserved for the first time that a 2D phonon spectrum clearly changes thetemperature dependence and strength of the e-p scattering rate, with theinteraction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below $\sim$ 0.5 K forthe 30 nm membranes.
  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finitebackground in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on anintegrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinearSchr\"{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply theinverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. Theresulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those undervanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicitmanner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified intotwo kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type impliesthe ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies thepolar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-solitoncollisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in acollision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of theprevious studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions anddark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness ofthe multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.
  This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in whichwe described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deformgeometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions ofsingularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related byonly a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. Andbecause the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute thesuperpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness ofgeometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case ofdeforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Modelcontent. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometricallyengineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how thethree families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of asingle, isolated E8 singularity.
  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe thecorrelation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity inthe HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with theassumption of a constant star formation efficiency.
  Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet beltsmore distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass ofsolids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The starretains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can beused to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes arecorrectly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for formingmassive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. Byextrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-likeplanets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-massexo-planets.
  Using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerablewavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data forcorrelation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerablewavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one todefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation betweenthe WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. Themost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of thesigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspectingsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see thecorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination andinstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of allsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on theISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation inducedbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of theUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, ourdetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence fordark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future tohelp us to better understand the nature of dark energy.
  We have measured the polarizations of $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons asfunctions of their transverse momentum $\pt$ when they are produced promptly inthe rapidity range $|y|<0.6$ with $\pt \geq 5 \pgev$. The analysis is performedusing a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about $800 \ipb$ collectedby the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizationsbecome increasingly longitudinal as $\pt$ increases from 5 to $30 \pgev$. Theseresults are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantumchromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of$\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons from $B$-hadron decays are also reported.
  We have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of as-grownand oxygen-reduced Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ and Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_4$electron-doped cuprates. In contrast to the common belief, neither the bandfilling nor the band parameters are significantly affected by the oxygenreduction process. Instead, we show that the main electronic role of thereduction process is to remove an anisotropic leading edge gap around the Fermisurface. While the nodal leading edge gap is induced by long-rangeantiferomagnetic order, the origin of the antinodal one remains unclear.
  We propose the Z -> gamma gamma decay, a process strictly forbidden in thestandard model, as a signal suitable for the search of noncommutativity ofcoordinates at very short distances. We compute the Z -> gamma gamma partialwidthin the framework of the recently proposed renormalizable gauge sector ofthe noncommutative standard model. The one-loop renormalizability is obtainedfor the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of thefirst generation. Even more, the noncommutative part is finite or free ofdivergences, showing that perhaps new interaction symmetry exists in thenoncommutative gauge sector of the model. Discovery of such symmetry would beof tremendous importance in further search for the violation of the Lorentzinvariance at very high energies. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gammagamma decay are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativityparameter is set around 1 TeV.
  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on theprobability density function of measured variables. It is expressed byexperimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectivelyby the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physicallaw, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimentaldata by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from thekernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. Theproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisychaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predicta future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictorerror is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy isexpressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics areused in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of thepredictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.
  Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. An \emph{$n$-potent} is an element $e$ of aring $R$ such that $e^n = e$. In this paper, we study $n$-potents in matricesover $R$ and use them to construct an abelian group $K_0^n(R)$. If $A$ is acomplex algebra, there is a group isomorphism $K_0^n(A) \cong\bigl(K_0(A)\bigr)^{n-1}$ for all $n \geq 2$. However, for algebras overcyclotomic fields, this is not true in general. We consider $K_0^n$ as acovariant functor, and show that it is also functorial for a generalization ofhomomorphism called an \emph{$n$-homomorphism}.
  We study the sodium D lines (D1: 5895.92 \AA; D2: 5889.95 \AA) in late-typedwarf stars. The stars have spectral types between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtainedmedium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinianobservatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition ofthe pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define acontinuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D linesis computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previousstudies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between theflux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected forthe photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromosphericactivity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, wefind that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate influx stars of unknown colour.
  Here, we present theoretical studies of the temperature and magnetic fielddependences of the Coulomb drag transresistivity between two parallel layers oftwo dimensional electron gases in quantum Hall regime near half filling of thelowest Landau level. It is shown that Fermi-liquid interactions between therelevant quasiparticles could give a significant effect on thetransresistivity, providing its independence of the interlayer spacing forspacings taking on values reported in the experiments. Obtained results agreewith the experimental evidence.
  The present work is focused on theoretical and experimental study oflocalised levels in organic materials suitable for light-emitting devices andfield effect transistors by means of thermal techniques. In our work we focusedon low molecular compounds as well as on polymers, especially of two classes ofmaterials: oxadiazoles and quinoxalines. Both organic compounds are well knowas electron transport materials in OLEDs.
  We propose a scheme for circuit quantum electrodynamics with asuperconducting flux-qubit coupled to a high-Q coplanar resonator. Assumingrealistic circuit parameters we predict that it is possible to reach the strongcoupling regime. Routes to metrological applications, such as single photongeneration and quantum non-demolition measurements are discussed.
  In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified withthe zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The massof the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warpedspacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gaugecouplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantialdeviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings aresuppressed by a factor \cos \theta_H from the values in the standard model,where \theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These canbe tested at LHC and ILC.
  In this paper we study the shape of least-energy solutions to a singularlyperturbed quasilinear problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. Weuse an intrinsic variation method to show that at limit, the global maximumpoint of least-energy solutions goes to a point on the boundary faster than thelinear rate and this point on the boundary approaches to a point where the meancurvature of the boundary achieves its maximum. We also give a complete proofof exponential decay of least-energy solutions.
  I review the status of science with wide field surveys. For many decadessurveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are anefficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; tomap intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to addresssome problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent widefield surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of theexciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new fieldstudying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I thenlook briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially allwavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to betoo expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : thefirst is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; andthe second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.
  We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $n\times n$ banded Toeplitzmatrices as $n\to \infty$. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer andHirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in thecomplex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weaklyto a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize thelimiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure isone component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energyfunctional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show thateach of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized countingmeasure on certain generalized eigenvalues.
  An analytical description of the interface motion of a collapsingnanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of theRayleigh-Plesset equation in conjunction with explicit solvent moleculardynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the twoapproaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solventconditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to becorrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface orcollapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension andfluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correctionaccelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossoverscales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicitmodeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems innonequilibrium.
  We build a sequence of empirical measures on the space D(R_+,R^d) ofR^d-valued c\`adl\`ag functions on R_+ in order to approximate the law of astationary R^d-valued Markov and Feller process (X_t). We obtain some generalresults of convergence of this sequence. Then, we apply them to Browniandiffusions and solutions to L\'evy driven SDE's under some Lyapunov-typestability assumptions. As a numerical application of this work, we show thatthis procedure gives an efficient way of option pricing in stochasticvolatility models.
  The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in termsof the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can beunderstood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certainconstraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are nkinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii)Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only blackhandles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of anexterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it isshown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon fromthat with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flatspace-times.
  The extended lobes of radio galaxies are examined as sources of X-ray andgamma-ray emission via inverse Compton scattering of 3K background photons. TheCompton spectra of two exemplary examples, Fornax A and Centaurus A, areestimated using available radio measurements in the ~10's MHz - 10's GHz range.For average lobe magnetic fields of >~0.3-1 micro-G, the lobe spectra arepredicted to extend into the soft gamma-rays making them likely detectable withthe GLAST LAT. If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) willmake it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, thisprocess operates in more distant radio galaxies and the possibility that suchsystems will be detected as unresolved gamma-ray sources with GLAST is brieflyconsidered.
  In this note we present three representations of a 248-dimensional Liealgebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system offive trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty-four, thatadmitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each oforder twenty-eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differentialequation of order two hundred and forty-four.
  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disksurrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in theoptical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkableproperty of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extremelength asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical tonear-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grainscattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of alarge debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership inthe Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematicsalone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamicalperturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galacticspace velocity, and age.
  We discuss an alternative non-perturbative proof of Bertrand's theorem thatleads in a concise way directly to the two allowed fields: the newtonian andthe isotropic harmonic oscillator central fields.
  We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03at z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400galaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members areselected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by theirphotometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster andfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The bestfitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixedfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. Therate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistentwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internalmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for thegeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in differentenvironments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, butthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. Anonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively andthe overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It isunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from thesurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their starformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.
  Correlation-driven screening of disorder is studied within the typical-mediumdynamical mean-field theory (TMT-DMFT) of the Mott-Anderson transition. In thestrongly correlated regime, the site energies epsilon_R^i characterizing theeffective disorder potential are strongly renormalized due to the phenomenon ofKondo pinning. This effect produces very strong screening when the interactionU is stronger then disorder W, but applies only to a fraction of the sites inthe opposite limit (U<W).
  In this paper, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions ofseparability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.Let $M$ be the matrix of the amplitudes of $\ket\psi$, we prove $M$ is acompact operator. We also prove $\ket\psi$ is separable if and only if $M$ is abounded linear operator with rank 1, that is the image of $M$ is a onedimensional Hilbert space. So we have related the separability for bipartitepure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces to an important class ofbounded linear operators in Functional analysis which has many interestingproperties.
  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimumoutdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently largedigraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound onthe minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture ofManoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree whichensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for everyordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle whichencounters these vertices in this order.
  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group ofRiemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing anatural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on aclassical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and thenproving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically ona given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularityassumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universalobject in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smoothisometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also constructa spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifoldwhich is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of thequantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groupsof commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantumdouble torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group ofholomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.
  We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificiallycreated scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid.The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function ofthe load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simplefunctional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeedpossible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest thatour method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularlyimportant for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascadingfailures.
  We compare the dependences on the number of colors of the leading pion pionscattering amplitudes using the single index quark field and two index quarkfields. These are seen to have different relationships to the scatteringamplitudes suggested by chiral dynamics which can explain the long puzzlingpion pion s wave scattering up to about 1 GeV. This may be interesting forgetting a better understanding of the large Nc approach as well as forapplication to recently proposed technicolor models.
  We present the expansion of the two-pion exchange three-nucleon potential(TPE-3NP) to chiral order q^4, which corresponds to a subset of allpossibilities at this order and is based on the \piN amplitude at O(q^3).Results encompass both numerical corrections to strength coefficients ofprevious O(q^3) terms and new structures in the profile functions. The formerare typically smaller than 10% whereas the latter arise from either loopfunctions or non-local gradients acting on the wave function. The influence ofthe new TPE-3NP over static and scattering three-body observables has beenassessed and found to be small, as expected from perturbative corrections.
  The Klein-Gordon equation in D-dimensions for a recently proposed Kratzerpotential plus ring-shaped potential is solved analytically by means of theconventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The exact energy bound-states and thecorresponding wave functions of the Klein-Gordon are obtained in the presenceof the noncentral equal scalar and vector potentials. The results obtained inthis work are more general and can be reduced to the standard forms inthree-dimensions given by other works.
  I discuss low energy aspects of heavy meson decays, where there is at leastone heavy meson in the final state. Examples are $B -\bar{B}$ mixing, $B \to D\bar{D}$, $B \to D \eta'$, and $B \to D \gamma$. %and $B \to D W $ (Isgur-Wisefunction). The analysis is performed in the heavy quark limit withinheavy-light chiral perturbation theory. Coefficients of $1/N_c$ suppressedchiral Lagrangian terms (beyond factorization) have been estimated by means ofa heavy-light chiral quark model.
  We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulombinteraction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\barD}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Weconsider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospinI=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. Wefind that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scatteringphase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\barK}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in thecharged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phasesin both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply thesame approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass differencebetween the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scatteringeffects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect ofthis mass difference.
  We illustrate through example 1 and 2 that the condition at theorem 1 in [8]dissatisfies necessity, and the converse proposition of fact 1.1 in [8] doesnot hold, namely the condition Z/M - L/Ak < 1/(2 Ak^2) is not sufficient forf(i) + f(j) = f(k). Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is alogic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4to be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination ofqu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +f(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4and alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,manifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 isfalsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. Tothe signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1and Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.Therefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (whichconnotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key inREESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitlyselected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.
  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip inthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets theankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\itankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pairproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dipscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be aclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenicneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, andfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as longas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. Onthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalacticprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge whichscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrinobackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs andGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic raysources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us informationon the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expectedsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection ofcosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.
  The possible existence of axion-like particles could lead to a new type oflong distance communication. In this work, basic antenna concepts are definedand a Friis-like equation is derived to facilitate long-distance linkcalculations. An example calculation is presented showing that communicationover distances of 1000 km or more may be possible for $m_{a}< 3.5$ meV and$g_{a\gamma \gamma} > 5 \times 10^{- 8} {\text{GeV}}^{- 1}$.
  The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally andnumerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantumgenerator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous worksarXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050)Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction onthe external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE wereobserved in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At thepumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number ofcoexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and incomputer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branchingdensity in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses isclosely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strangeattractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of thehigher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.
  Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, andtypes $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxetergroups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of aCoxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in asubgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisationis "minimal" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s,$i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, thesedecomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using asomewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux onmap enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ andfixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le\pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitionsposet, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the "blockstructure" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result impliesall known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossingpartitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chainenumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chainenumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.
  We search for stellar and substellar companions of young nearby stars toinvestigate stellar multiplicity and formation of stellar and substellarcompanions. We detect common proper-motion companions of stars via multi-epochimaging. Their companionship is finally confirmed with photometry andspectroscopy. Here we report the discovery of a new co-moving (13 sigma)stellar companion ~17.8 arcsec (350 AU in projected separation) north of thenearby star HD141272 (21 pc). With EMMI/NTT optical spectroscopy we determinedthe spectral type of the companion to be M3+-0.5V. The derived spectral type aswell as the near infrared photometry of the companion are both fully consistentwith a 0.26+-0.07 Msol dwarf located at the distance of HD141272 (21 pc).Furthermore the photometry data rules out the pre-main sequence status, sincethe system is consistent with the ZAMS of the Pleiades.
  In this paper we investigate the optimal control problem for a class ofstochastic Cauchy evolution problem with non standard boundary dynamic andcontrol. The model is composed by an infinite dimensional dynamical systemcoupled with a finite dimensional dynamics, which describes the boundaryconditions of the internal system. In other terms, we are concerned with nonstandard boundary conditions, as the value at the boundary is governed by adifferent stochastic differential equation.
  We study the relaxational critical dynamics of the three-dimensional randomanisotropy magnets with the non-conserved n-component order parameter coupledto a conserved scalar density. In the random anisotropy magnets the structuraldisorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of randomorientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edgesof the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical propertiescoincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disordergives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. Weinvestigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization groupanalysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtainquantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents ofthe order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenariosfor the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.
  A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectilespectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratorywith the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides aprimary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at theFRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopiccompositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similarfor all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed inboth neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtainedfrom the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared withthe limiting-temperature expectation.
  We show that axinos, which are dominantly generated by the decay of thenext-to-lightest supersymmetric particles produced from the leptonic $Q$-ball($L$-ball), become warm dark matter suitable for the solution of the missingsatellite problem and the cusp problem. In addition, $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$coincidence is naturally explained in this scenario.
  The ghost and gluon propagator and the ghost-gluon and three-gluon vertex oftwo-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (minimal) Landau gauge are studiedusing lattice gauge theory. It is found that the results are qualitativelysimilar to the ones in three and four dimensions. The propagators and theFaddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario.In addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions areinvestigated systematically. The critical infrared exponents of thepropagators, as proposed in calculations using stochastic quantization andDyson-Schwinger equations, are confirmed quantitatively. For this purposelattices of volume up to (42.7 fm)^2 have been used.
  We compute temperate fundamental solutions of homogeneous differentialoperators with real-principal type symbols. Via analytic continuation ofmeromorphic distributions, fundamental solutions for these non-ellipticoperators can be constructed in terms of radial averages and invariantdistributions on the unit sphere.
  We compute the current voltage characteristic of a chain of identicalJosephson circuits characterized by a large ratio of Josephson to chargingenergy that are envisioned as the implementation of topologically protectedqubits. We show that in the limit of small coupling to the environment itexhibits a non-monotonous behavior with a maximum voltage followed by aparametrically large region where $V\propto 1/I$. We argue that itsexperimental measurement provides a direct probe of the amplitude of thequantum transitions in constituting Josephson circuits and thus allows theirfull characterization.
  This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recoveringthe \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electricalimpedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence hasfocussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paperaims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivativeof the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover thegeometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivativesneeded to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate thestability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severelyill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.
  We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallelellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. Afteridentifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a carefulzero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, wedetermine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with thehelp of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of thismodel are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnarphase for intermediate temperatures.
  We argue that the critical behaviour near the point of ``gradientcatastrophe" of the solution to the Cauchy problem for the focusing nonlinearSchr\"odinger equation $ i\epsilon \psi_t +\frac{\epsilon^2}2\psi_{xx}+|\psi|^2 \psi =0$ with analytic initial data of the form $\psi(x,0;\epsilon)=A(x) e^{\frac{i}{\epsilon} S(x)}$ is approximately described by a particularsolution to the Painlev\'e-I equation.
  It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation ofperturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms inone-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certainLorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables whichgive rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms.These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator,introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulationsof Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of ourproposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is thegenerating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicityamplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.
  This article discusses completeness of Boolean Algebra as First Order Theoryin Goedel's meaning. If Theory is complete then any possible transformation isequivalent to some transformation using axioms, predicates etc. defined forthis theory. If formula is to be proved (or disproved) then it has to bereduced to axioms. If every transformation is deducible then also optimaltransformation is deducible. If every transformation is exponential thenoptimal one is too, what allows to define lower bound for discussed problem tobe exponential (outside P). Then we show algorithm for NDTM solving the sameproblem in O(n^c) (so problem is in NP), what proves that P \neq NP.  Article proves also that result of relativisation of P=NP question and oracleshown by Baker-Gill-Solovay distinguish between deterministic andnon-deterministic calculation models. If there exists oracle A for whichP^A=NP^A then A consists of infinite number of algorithms, DTMs, axioms andpredicates, or like NDTM infinite number of simultaneous states.
  We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution ofparticles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-holddistribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. Insimulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to theaccelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging fromthe interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We setthe criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Protonangles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forwardprotons at the LHC.
  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-rayemission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuseemission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced bycollisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young Ostars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart frommassive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution forextended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring keyemission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern sideof the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectraof the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell linesof iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the corethese lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermalplasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3abundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma mightoriginate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.
  Honeypots are more and more used to collect data on malicious activities onthe Internet and to better understand the strategies and techniques used byattackers to compromise target systems. Analysis and modeling methodologies areneeded to support the characterization of attack processes based on the datacollected from the honeypots. This paper presents some empirical analyses basedon the data collected from the Leurr{\'e}.com honeypot platforms deployed onthe Internet and presents some preliminary modeling studies aimed at fulfillingsuch objectives.
  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objectsassociated with sections of star bodies and invoking  Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourieranalysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalizedcosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application toinvestigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call$\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in thesense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensionalsubspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosinetransforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result tothe study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations ofthis class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review someknown facts and give them new proofs.
  We consider the correction $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ due toelectron-electron interaction to the conductivity of a weakly disordered metal(Al'tshuler-Aronov correction). The correction is related to the spectraldeterminant of the Laplace operator. The case of a large square metallicnetwork is considered. The variation of $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as afunction of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation ofthe weak localization $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{WL}(L_\phi)$ as a function of thephase coherence length. Our result for $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ interpolatesbetween the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering theexpression of $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour. Quitesurprisingly, the result is very close to the 2d logarithmic behaviour alreadyfor $L_T\sim{a}/2$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.
  Microlensing is a proven extrasolar planet search method that has alreadyyielded the detection of four exoplanets. These detections have changed ourunderstanding of planet formation ``beyond the snowline'' by demonstrating thatNeptune-mass planets with separations of several AU are common. Microlensing issensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods, inparticular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e.terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide criticalconstraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation ofextrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-fundedmicrolensing component. When combined with the results from other complementarysurveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate andcomplete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particularlow-mass terrestrial planets.
  We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario ofhep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, weconsider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent inthe presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure attree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification ofsoft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. Wealso comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fiberedCalabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discussfurther checks that need to be performed.
  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in differentmarkets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuationsin the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emergingmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared todeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown tobe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging tothe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sectoridentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the networkof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted byrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactionsbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamicswith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internalstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is asignature of market development.
  The COsmic Foreground Explorer (COFE) is a balloon-borne microwave polarime-ter designed to measure the low-frequency and low-l characteristics of dominantdiffuse polarized foregrounds. Short duration balloon flights from the Northernand Southern Hemispheres will allow the telescope to cover up to 80% of the skywith an expected sensitivity per pixel better than 100 $\mu K / deg^2$ from 10GHz to 20 GHz. This is an important effort toward characterizing the polarizedforegrounds for future CMB experiments, in particular the ones that aim todetect primordial gravity wave signatures in the CMB polarization angular powerspectrum.
  In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at aconjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is therelative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven inthis paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses thequantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channelcapacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead togeneralization of the conjecture.
  We consider a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for thevelocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use aprojection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. In a formerpaper, the stability of the scheme has been proven. We infer from it itsconvergence.
  We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High EnergyTransmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\em Chandra X-rayObservatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration ofthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part ofthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. Thisimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescaleof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during theobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines aregenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in thebinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physicalcondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.
  We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-fielddiffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces.The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitudedependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It isshown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalentto replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analyticexpression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces wellthe asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transientsurface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between thismodel and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient"near-zone" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includesthe asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transientnear-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design andoptimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large partwill be controlled by surface waves.
  Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part IIdiscusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of twocontinuous acoustic emission sources.  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location ofdeveloping defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of variousstatistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis isseparation and characterization of signal components when the signals fromvarious sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind sourceseparation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solvethese problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicabilityof ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emissionsources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising fornon-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emissionanalysis.
  The study of the innermost circumstellar layers around AGB stars is crucialto understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emissionoccurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing directinformation on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physicalproperties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of theSiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine}the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines inthe oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecondresolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiOv=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0J=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in otheroxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emittingregions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to thecentral star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farthershell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in RLeo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of thedifferent maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.
  Product probability property, known in the literature as statisticalindependence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, allof which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the natureof the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmicfunctional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannonentropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations havingproduct probability property. It is argued that the natural process isnon-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even inproduct probability property situations and additivity can hold due to theinvolvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and someof the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropyleads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and relateddifferential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of"inaccuracy" is also explored.
  The most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in theirglobular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms whichlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a completepicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular clusterformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radialvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &Matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute thedistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentricradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globularclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that theobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals canbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellarpopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich populationof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in verygood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigatethe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicitydistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role ofmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicitytransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model(abridged)
  We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolatedquantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, thedrive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased,detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in theopposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current ismaximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between itsquantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. Weinterpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-inducedexcitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.
  We present sensitive molecular line observations of the metal-poor bluecompact dwarf I Zw 18 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer.These data constrain the CO J=1-0 luminosity within our 300 pc (FWHM) beam tobe L_CO < 1 \times 10^5 K km s^-1 pc^2 (I_CO < 1 K km s^-1), an order ofmagnitude lower than previous limits. Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it hasa CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to itsB-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarfstarburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing thestar formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gasforms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it musthave a very low CO-to-H_2 ratio, \sim 10^-2 times the Galactic value. We detect3mm continuum emission, presumably due to thermal dust and free-free emission,towards the radio peak.
  The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may openup new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handedneutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgsboson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays aresubdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopicdecay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displacedvertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performedusing the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these noveldecay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimentalconstraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the questionof whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on theapproximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.
  We review the possibility that the Supersymmetric Standard Model arises fromorbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring, and thephenomenological properties that such a model should have. In particular,trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by theHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEPexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies ofthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding thatviable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.
  Let $(A,\Theta)$ be a principally polarised abelian variety, and let Y be asubvariety. Pareschi and Popa conjectured that Y has minimal cohomology classif and only if the structure sheaf of Y satisfies a property that they callM-regularity.  Let now X be a smooth cubic threefold. By a classical result due to Clemensand Griffiths, its intermediate Jacobian J(X) is a principally polarisedabelian variety; furthermore the Fano surface of lines on X can be embedded inJ(X) and has minimal cohomology class. In this short note we show that itsstructure sheaf is M-regular.
  We present a new version of TaylUR, a Fortran 95 module to automaticallycompute the numerical values of a complex-valued function's derivatives withrespect to several variables up to an arbitrary order in each variable, butexcluding mixed derivatives. The new version fixes a potentially serious bug inthe code for exponential-related functions that could corrupt the imaginaryparts of derivatives, as well as being compatible with a wider range ofcompilers.
  We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of starformation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at ametallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including theradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamicsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, tothe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations withcosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, withmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. Thesimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar corereveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two withmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that sharemost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-massproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lowerlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the secondgeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still moremassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.
  We quantify the contributions of hyperfine and spin-orbit mediatedsinglet-triplet mixing in weakly coupled InAs quantum dots by electrontransport spectroscopy in the Pauli spin blockade regime. In contrast to doubledots in GaAs, the spin-orbit coupling is found to be more than two orders ofmagnitudes larger than the hyperfine mixing energy. It is already effective atmagnetic fields of a few mT, where deviations from hyperfine mixing areobserved.
  While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by thepresence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, theyare quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer lineprofiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness.We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetriccharacteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclinationangle effects. The increasing number of known "hybrid" SNe with IIn-likeemission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common aroundall types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlationsbetween spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help usaddress the question of classification of "interacting SNe" and the possibilityof distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.
  We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issueof overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packetssent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasinglylong packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols perpacket or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rateapproaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasureprobability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for aparticular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero fora large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in theperformance gains offered by random network coding.
  We construct a class of analytic solutions of WZW-type open superstring fieldtheory describing marginal deformations of a reference D-brane background. Thedeformations we consider are generated by on-shell vertex operators withvanishing operator products. The superstring solution exhibits an intriguingduality with the corresponding marginal solution of the {\it bosonic} string.In particular, the superstring problem is ``dual'' to the problem ofre-expressing the bosonic marginal solution in pure gauge form. This representsthe first nonsingular analytic solution of open superstring field theory.
  Our main result in this paper is the following: Given $H^m, H^n$ hyperbolicspaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function$f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundariesof $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map$u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense ofEuclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.
  The density of states and energy spectrum of the gluon radiation arecalculated for the color current of an expanding hydrodynamic skyrmion in thequark gluon plasma with a semiclassical method. Results are compared with thosein literatures.
  Let $\Goo$ be a semisimple real Lie group with unitary dual $\Ghat$. The goalof this note is to produce new upper bounds for the multiplicities with whichrepresentations $\pi \in \Ghat$ of cohomological type appear in certain spacesof cusp forms on $\Goo$.
  We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, theyoung energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnantG54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and ChandraX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 mspulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolutionshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noiseand/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsedemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma =1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. Thetotal 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.
  We discuss the possibility of GLAST detecting gamma-rays from theannihilation of neutralino dark matter in the Galactic halo. We have used "ViaLactea", currently the highest resolution simulation of Galactic cold darkmatter substructure, to quantify the contribution of subhalos to theannihilation signal. We present a simulated allsky map of the expectedgamma-ray counts from dark matter annihilation, assuming standard values ofparticle mass and cross section. In this case GLAST should be able to detectthe Galactic center and several individual subhalos.
  In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\'e lattice, of cornersharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show thatdespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains verylarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracylifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, thedegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are thereforeintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the sameordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chiralityHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transitionon increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a newferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This isconfirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. Whilethe saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ correctionsselect the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantumlimit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small systemdiagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediatetemperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seenin NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classicalground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.
  We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nucleiin intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It isshown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger atlower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulombdistortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleonand as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beamfacilities are discussed.
  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bidsand distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantumstate gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying thesuperposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can useentanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurancethat this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful forinformation hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocativeexternality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocolapplies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and toauctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of thequantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how asuitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders togame the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather thatcomputational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.
  We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by anon-local Hamiltonian can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. Given abipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, theentangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d isthe smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operatornorm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on theinitial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assistedentangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of localancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinctSchmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily largemultiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functionalmeasuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independentstate with a state evolving unitarily.
  We present an algorithm for systematic encoding of Hermitian codes. For aHermitian code defined over GF(q^2), the proposed algorithm achieves a run timecomplexity of O(q^2) and is suitable for VLSI implementation. The encoderarchitecture uses as main blocks q varying-rate Reed-Solomon encoders andachieves a space complexity of O(q^2) in terms of finite field multipliers andmemory elements.
  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbitsaround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order inQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiationreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to theCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change ofthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan hascomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which islinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic inthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reactionfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of thequadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentricorbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetryaxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has asingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, weshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such asystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additionalassumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetricspacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.
  We search for and characterize substructures in the projected distribution ofgalaxies observed in the wide field CCD images of the 77 nearby clusters of theWIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS). This sample is complete inX-ray flux in the redshift range 0.04<z<0.07. We search for substructures inWINGS clusters with DEDICA, an adaptive-kernel procedure. We test the procedureon Monte-Carlo simulations of the observed frames and determine the reliabilityfor the detected structures. DEDICA identifies at least one reliable structurein the field of 55 clusters. 40 of these clusters have a total of 69substructures at the same redshift of the cluster (redshift estimates ofsubstructures are from color-magnitude diagrams). The fraction of clusters withsubclusters (73%) is higher than in most studies. The presence of subclustersaffects the relative luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).Down to L ~ 10^11.2 L_Sun, our observed differential distribution of subclusterluminosities is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the differentialmass function of substructures in cosmological simulations.
  Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in asample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. Thesample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relicsof radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution orpossibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were madeusing MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps arepresented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some ofthe sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore acomplicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. Oneof the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio andinfrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS objectwhose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. Theyoung age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolutionscenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre fluxof 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.
  We study the effect of the coronal background in the determination of thediameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followedin a previous paper (L\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\'emoulin 2006) forcharacterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create differentsynthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained withthe Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to theseloops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare theresults with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allowsus to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably withheight, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even forloops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loopsare below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find thatsmall-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due toimperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur inespecially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially brightrelative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact theability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops donot expand systematically with height is robust.
  We study effects of two-flavor color superconductivity on the structure ofstrange dwarfs, which are stellar objects with similar masses and radii withordinary white dwarfs but stabilized by the strange quark matter core. We findthat unpaired quark matter is a good approximation to the core of strangedwarfs.
  Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to anonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. Theweights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve asan ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper wedemonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing thatequilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. Forthis system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficientthan constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth consideringwhenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at thebeginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), asit is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.
  This paper is devoted to describe the finite-dimensionality of atwo-dimensional micropolar fluid flow with periodic boundary conditions. Wedefine the notions of determining modes and nodes and estimate the number ofthem, we also estimate the dimension of the global attractor. Finally wecompare our results with analogous results for Navier-Stokes equation.
  We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravitywith a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmologicalsingularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential andunbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations hasquasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usualanisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending onthe strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantumgravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of fieldcorrelation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another withquasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases isinterpreted as the condensation of gravitons.
  The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a randomvariable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of ani.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowablepredictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approachasymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in theclass. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at somefinite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,the underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, wegive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictorperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas areillustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.
  Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates arediscussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as aclassical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effectiveminimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. Bysolving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures wherethe mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trapgeometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipoleinteraction.
  Results of the first-principles calculations are presented for the group-VBmetals V, Nb and Ta up to couple of megabar pressure. An unique structuralphase transition sequence BCC-->(at 60 GPa) rhombohedral (angle=110.5degree)-->(at ~ 160 GPa)rhombohedral(angle=108.5 degree)--> (at ~ 430 GPa) BCCis predicted in V. We also find that BCC-V becomes mechanically andvibrationally unstable at around 112 GPa pressure. Similar transitions areabsent in Nb and Ta.
  Theoretical analysis of interplay between the condensates $<\bar{q}q>$ and$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in themean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ arerespectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$and a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, onlypure $<\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is biggerthan the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermionsentering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models willmanifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3Dmodel, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates,besides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phasediagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a realconstraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.
  The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of themost important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting thespin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurementson specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependenceof the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoreticalmodels. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterizedby large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is alsopredicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. Thistype of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for theimplementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generatemicrowave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize thetheoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of thetorque.
  Suppose that $h$ and $g$ belong to the algebra $\B$ generated by the rationalfunctions and an entire function $f$ of finite order on ${\Bbb C}^n$ and that$h/g$ has algebraic polar variety. We show that either $h/g\in\B$ or$f=q_1e^p+q_2$, where $p$ is a polynomial and $q_1,q_2$ are rational functions.In the latter case, $h/g$ belongs to the algebra generated by the rationalfunctions, $e^p$ and $e^{-p}$.
  We calculate the intensity of the polariton mediated inelastic lightscattering in semiconductor microcavities. We treat the exciton-photon couplingnonperturbatively and incorporate lifetime effects in both excitons andphotons, and a coupling of the photons to the electron-hole continuum. Takingthe matrix elements as fitting parameters, the results are in excellentagreement with measured Raman intensities due to optical phonons resonant withthe upper polariton branches in II-VI microcavities with embedded CdTe quantumwells.
  The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to acommunication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with theirrespective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of thesenders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the messagebeing transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively hasadvantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussiancases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rateregions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in thehigh-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offerconsiderable improvements over these existing results.
  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study andclassification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. Inthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifoldadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along theselines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having areal-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. Inthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. Todo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularitiesand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give anelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddleconfigurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate ifother classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. Atthis purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, weconsider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those componentsadmitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admitsonly weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphicto $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence ofa closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-typeresult.
  Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns canbe inferred from computer databases of published papers. The geneticprogramming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. Inaddition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditorrelationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treatthese relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals thecommunity structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysisdiscovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigationreveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in otherscientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller centralnetwork component and a high clustering.
  We have carried out a comparative statistical study for the displacement ofthe Sun from the Galactic plane (z_\odot) following three different methods.The study has been done using a sample of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) withlog(Age) < 8.5 lying within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 2030 OB starsobserved up to a distance of 1200 pc, all of them have distance information. Wedecompose the Gould Belt's member in a statistical sense before investigatingthe variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits inthe heliocentric distance and distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Wefound z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtaineddue to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no suchdeviation is seen for the YOCs. We also determined scale heights of56.9(+3.8)(-3.4} and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distribution of YOCs and OBstars respectively.
  We prove that if a group is nilpotent (resp. metabelian), then so is thesubgroup of its automorphism group generated by all polynomial automorphisms.
  As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion ofconditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced bypositive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presentsseveral positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and ananalogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means ofmultilinear function series.
  We construct a classical solution of an Einstein-Yang-Mills system with afourth order term with respect to the field strength of the Yang-Mills field.The solution provides a spontaneous compactification proposed by Cremmer andScherk; ten-dimensional space-time with a cosmological constant is compactifiedto the four-dimensional Minkowski space with a six-dimensional sphere S^6 onwhich an instanton solution exists. The radius of the sphere is not a modulusbut is determined by the gauge coupling and the four-derivative couplingconstants and the Newton's constant. We also construct a solution often-dimensional theory without a cosmological constant compactified to AdS_4 xS^6.
  We investigate the large baryon number sector of the Einstein-Skyrme model asa possible model for baryon stars. Gravitating hedgehog skyrmions have beeninvestigated previously and the existence of stable solitonic stars excludeddue to energy considerations. However, in this paper we demonstrate that bygenerating gravitating skyrmions using rational maps, we can achievemulti-baryon bound states whilst recovering spherical symmetry in the limitwhere B becomes large.
  The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin andrepulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair ofp-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuationof many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the statescan be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation isstudied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originatingfrom the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to theappearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided intobeing collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relationbetween the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.
  We study a system of two quantum dots connected by a hopping bridge. Both thedots and connecting region are assumed to be in universal crossover regimesbetween Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. Using a diagrammaticapproach appropriate for energy separations much larger than the level spacingwe obtain the ensemble-averaged one- and two-particle Green's functions. Itturns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green'sfunction can be described by separate scaling functions. We then use thisinformation to investigate a model interacting system in which one dot has anattractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while theother is noninteracting but subject to an orbital magnetic field. We find thatthe critical temperature is {\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the seconddot in a certain regime of interdot coupling. Likewise, the fluctuationmagnetization above the critical temperature is also nonmonotonic in thisregime, can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and can be deduced from thecooperon scaling function.
  The existence of Neel order in the S=1/2 Heisenberg model on the squarelattice at T=0 is shown using inequalities set up by Kennedy, Lieb and Shastryin combination with high precision Quantum Monte Carlo data.
  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems ofHilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class numberone. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field$\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms thatare possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.
  We calculate level densities and pairing gaps for an ultracold dilute gas offermionic atoms in harmonic traps under the influence of mean field andanharmonic quartic trap potentials. Super-shell structures, which were found inHartree-Fock calculations, are calculated analytically within periodic orbittheory as well as from WKB calculations. For attractive interactions, theunderlying level densities are crucial for pairing and super-shell structuresin gaps are predicted.
  The entanglement quantified by negativity of pure bipartite superposed statesis studied. We show that if the entanglement is quantified by the concurrencetwo pure states of high fidelity to one another still have nearly the sameentanglement. Furthermore this conclusion can be guaranteed by our obtainedinequality, and the concurrence is shown to be a continuous function even ininfinite dimensions. The bounds on the negativity of superposed states in termsof those of the states being superposed are obtained. These bounds can finduseful applications in estimating the amount of the entanglement of a givenpure state.
  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with ahigh degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-modedeformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy togravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implicationsfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as corecollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such lowT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in thenonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, whichshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside thecorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-modedeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation areconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays animportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainableamplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.
  We define the secondary invariants L^2- eta and -rho forms for families ofgeneralized Dirac operators on normal coverings of fibre bundles. On thecovering family we assume transversally smooth spectral projections, andNovikov--Shubin invariants bigger than 3(dim B+1) to treat the large timeasymptotic for general operators. In the particular case of a bundle of spinmanifolds, we study the L^2- rho class in relation to the space of positivescalar curvature vertical metrics.
  Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highlyrobust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantumdots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transversemagnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of theexciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading toadjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electronspin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within apulse doublet sequence.
  We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes canhelp each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies inthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given themyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routingproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from thesource to the destination. We find that for a given route, thedecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperativecoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable bythe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperativecoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route whenthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategiesusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance ofthe strategies on different routes.
  We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system,where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflectionchanges non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain"optimal" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially largerprobability than at other energies.
  We explore the conductance of self-healing materials as a measure of thematerial integrity in the regime of the onset of the initial fatigue. Continuumeffective-field modeling and lattice numerical simulations are reported. Ourresults illustrate the general features of the self-healing process: The onsetof the material fatigue is delayed, by developing a plateau-liketime-dependence of the material quality. We demonstrate that in this low-damageregime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/responseproperties of the material can be used as measures of the material qualitydegradation.
  Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMAmethod in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relativelysmall number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods ofstatistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance ofmaximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large systemlimit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreadingmatrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with acomparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.
  We present a theory of transport through interacting quantum dots coupled tonormal and superconducting leads in the limit of weak tunnel coupling. AJosephson current between two superconducting leads, carried by first-ordertunnel processes, can be established by non-equilibrium proximity effect. BothAndreev and Josephson current is suppressed for bias voltages below a thresholdset by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent canbe driven by tuning gate or bias voltages.
  The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to beessentially composed of the nonresonant $\alpha_p(E_{0+})=+3.2$,$\alpha_n(E_{0+})=+4.1$,the $t$-channel $\alpha^t_{p,n}=-\beta^t_{p,n}=+7.6$and the resonant $\beta_{p,n}(P_{33}(1232))=+8.3$ contributions (in units of$10^{-4}$fm$^3$. The remaining deviations from the experimental data$\Delta\alpha_p=1.2\pm 0.6$, $\Delta\beta_p=1.2\mp 0.6$, \Delta\alpha_n=0.8\pm1.7$ and $\Delta\beta_n=2.0\mp 1.8$ are contributed by a larger number ofresonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between thecontributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electricand magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photoncouplings to the $\sigma$-meson having the predicted mass $m_\sigma=666$ MeVand two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=2.6$ keV.
  In this paper we present a recurrent relation for counting meaningfulcompositions of the higher-order differential operations on the space $R^{n}$(n=3,4,...) and extract the non-trivial compositions of order higher than two.
  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, thatrecovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced densitymatrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probabilitydistribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of purestate density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simplegenerating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when aquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of productsof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member ofthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unittrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descentrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, undercontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, weconsider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump processSchr\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding traceformalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownianmotion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markovmaster equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchiesgeneralizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggettmaster equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contraststochastic Schr\"odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the statevector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environmentbehaves like the latter.
  We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is ageneral method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. Weput the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, takingthe viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for theelectric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects,the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of themethod. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of lightscattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.
  A Relativistic Transport Model (ART1.0) is applied to simulate the stoppingeffects in tip-tip and body-body U+U collisions, at a beam kinetic energy of520 MeV/nucleon. Our simulation results have demonstrated that both centralcollisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and alsoform a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume andlong duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sidewardflow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-bodyones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-bodycentral collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$in contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and thenovel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can providea good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.The Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built atLanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expectedto make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state(EoS).
  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weaklensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merginggalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.
  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networkshave strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take intoaccount a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution isconditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with thestructural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happenin a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noiseaffected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibilityof emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected todifferent inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws dependingon the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network isconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing localand global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quicklyadapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysisshows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeplyphysical sense- the term gas here used.
  We show that two distinct quantum states of the electromagnetic field can beassociated to a classical vector X wave or a propagation-invariant solution ofMaxwell equations. The difference between the two states is of pure quantummechanical origin since they are internally entangled and disentangled,respectively and can be generated by different linear or nonlinear processes.Detection and generation of Schr\"odinger-cat states comprising two entangledX-waves and their possible applications are discussed.
  In the SK analysis of the neutrino events for [Fully Contained Events] and[Partially Contained Events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumedthat the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of thedetected charged lepton. In the present paper, we examine the validity of [theSK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking,we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [TimeSequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity ofthe SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate everyphysical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muonsunder [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtainedunder our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement ofthe direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring insidethe detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holdsirrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.
  Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $\om$ a smooth closed form ofbidegree $(1,1)$ which is nonnegative and big. We study the classes ${\mathcalE}_{\chi}(X,\om)$ of $\om$-plurisubharmonic functions of finite weightedMonge-Amp\`ere energy. When the weight $\chi$ has fast growth at infinity, thecorresponding functions are close to be bounded.  We show that if a positive Radon measure is suitably dominated by theMonge-Amp\`ere capacity, then it belongs to the range of the Monge-Amp\`ereoperator on some class ${\mathcal E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$. This is done byestablishing a priori estimates on the capacity of sublevel sets of thesolutions.  Our result extends U.Cegrell's and S.Kolodziej's results and puts them into aunifying frame. It also gives a simple proof of S.T.Yau's celebrated a priori${\mathcal C}^0$-estimate.
  We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties ofsets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced bysymplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples ofrigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of momentmaps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (followingthe works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possiblysingular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smoothfunctions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicityof the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on theFloer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.

  We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF.The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposedbroad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines ofneutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to thedereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and Hfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donorstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. Inaddition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak withrespect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restrictingthe spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparisonof the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the COabsorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarfstars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to thespectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines isobtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor starcontribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined withprevious published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =9.7+-0.6 M_solar.
  We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory ofsmall cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitelygenerated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugateelements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into suchgroups.  As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countablegroup $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$,where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) andcontaining exactly two conjugacy classes.
  We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames inspacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetricacceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertialaccelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency ofrotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related togravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fieldsadapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, andshow that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set oftetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of generalrelatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle ofequivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition ofgravitational energy.
  We show how an idealised measurement procedure can condense photons from twomodes into one, and how, by feeding forward the results of the measurement, itis possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which onlyone mode is populated, commonly called ``N00N states''. For the basicprocedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the outputports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fractionof the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the sameport with high probability, however large the initial state. When insteadphotons are detected at both ports, Schr\"{o}dinger cat states are produced. Wedescribe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, andanother for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scalesexponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications includequantum imaging and metrology.

  In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used tojudge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationshipbetween separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states inTheorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidtdecomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is moreprofound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the mainresults in [1]. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judgethe separability of multipartite pure states effectively.
  We present an x-ray spectromicroscopic investigation of single-crystallinemagnetic FeMn/Co bilayers on Cu(001), using X-ray magnetic circular (XMCD) andlinear (XMLD) dichroism at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges in combinationwith photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Using the magnetic couplingbetween the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we areable to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographicorientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time.We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types ofmagnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystallineanisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the highsensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe momentsat the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD ina metallic system.
  Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity, theelectronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the superconductingstate is studied. It is shown that the electron spectrum of bilayer cupratesuperconductors is split into the bonding and antibonding components by thebilayer splitting, then the observed peak-dip-hump structure around the$[\pi,0]$ point is mainly caused by this bilayer splitting, with thesuperconducting peak being related to the antibonding component, and the humpbeing formed by the bonding component. The spectral weight increases withincreasing the doping concentration. In analogy to the normal state case, bothelectron antibonding peak and bonding hump have the weak dispersions around the$[\pi,0]$ point.
  We report on direct measurements of the electronic shot noise of a quantumpoint contact at frequencies nu in the range 4-8 GHz. The very small energyscale used ensures energy independent transmissions of the few transmittedelectronic modes and their accurate knowledge. Both the thermal energy and thequantum point contact drain-source voltage Vds are comparable to the photonenergy hnu leading to observation of the shot noise suppression when$V_{ds}<h\nu/e$. Our measurements provide the first complete test of the finitefrequency shot noise scattering theory without adjustable parameters.
  A perturbative model is studied for the tunneling of many-particle statesfrom the ground band to the first excited energy band, mimicking Landau-Zenerdecay for ultracold, spinless atoms in quasi-one dimensional optical latticessubjected to a tunable tilting force. The distributions of the computedtunneling rates provide an independent and experimentally accessible signatureof the regular-chaotic transition in the strongly correlated many-body dynamicsof the ground band.
  Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matterfrom the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems,called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings ofthe compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companionstar, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions withparticular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. Thecase of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in somedetail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this typeof objects will be presented.
  Motivated by the observation of a gapless spin liquid state in$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, we analyze the anisotropic triangularlattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model with the resonating valence bond mean-fieldapproximation. Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropyof the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional (1D) chains coupledwith frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectrachanging anisotropy parameter $J'/J$ from the decoupled 1D chains to theisotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the widerange from the 1D limit. This one-dimensionalization by frustration isconsidered to be a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquidstate.
  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-raybursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, thespectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. Ashigh uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a carefulanalysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to thetime-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the correspondingparameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nupeak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagateduncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of ourhomogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm asignificant correlation between these two quantities (the "Amati" relation) andwe verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We alsofit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the "Amati" relation of non-SwiftGRBs.
  In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons$\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculatethe non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppresseddiagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in thesimple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results aregenerally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquarkmodel. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one orderlarger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. Thisdiscrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurateexperiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must besome unknown mechanism to be explored.
  Consider the family S of irreducible plane curves of degree n with d nodesand k cusps as singularities. Let W be an irreducible component of S. Weconsider the natural rational map from W to the moduli space of curves of genusg=(n-1)(n-2)/2-d-k. We define the "number of moduli of W" as the dimension ofthe image of W with respect to this map. If W has the expected dimension equalto 3n+g-1-k, then the number of moduli of W is at most equal to the min(3g-3,3g-3+\rho-k), dove \rho is the Brill-Neother number of the linear series ofdegree n and dimension 2 on a smooth curve of genus g. We say that W has theexpected number of moduli if the equality holds. In this paper we constructexamples of families of irreducible plane curves with nodes and cusps assingularities having expected number of moduli and with non-positiveBrill-Noether number.
  We show that braiding transformation is a natural approach to describequantum entanglement, by using the unitary braiding operators to realizeentanglement swapping and generate the GHZ states as well as the linear clusterstates. A Hamiltonian is constructed from the unitary$\check{R}_{i,i+1}(\theta,\phi)$-matrix, where $\phi=\omega t$ istime-dependent while $\theta$ is time-independent. This in turn allows us toinvestigate the Berry phase in the entanglement space.
  This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black holemagnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfectmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting fluxdominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in theergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplifiedlimit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, theergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible forgreatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic fluxthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release ofelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic fluxthreading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threadingthe equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the centralengine of powerful FRII quasars.
  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statisticalproperties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, fieldcitation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulativeadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of researchgroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent propertyof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have alarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations thantop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performanceuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably withsize. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of auniversity, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that theaverage research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performanceuniversities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range ofactivities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractivepower. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universitiesthe field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citationsper publication. The relation between number of citations and field citationdensity found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule ofthe science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals withsignificantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performanceuniversities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citationswith increasing research performance, average field citation density, andaverage journal impact.
  In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance twogoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar tothe Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present anew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towardsboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that isable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planettransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the timebetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to inferthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a massthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection techniquecomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motionresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reducedsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded thephotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTVplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number ofhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existingtelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transitingplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramaticallyincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.
  In response to the comment of Kenzelmann and Harris I show how the continuumtheory of spiral multiferroics can be modified to describe general magneticorders and discuss why the microscopic mechanism of magnetically-inducedferroelectricity usually makes such modifications unnecessary. This explainswhy the simple model with a single vector order parameter successfullydescribes thermodynamics and magnetoelectric properties of many spiralmultiferroics.
  The energy spectra of neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles have beenmeasured from the d+59Co and 3He+58Fe reactions leading to the same compoundnucleus, 61$Ni. The experimental cross sections have been compared toHauser-Feshbach model calculations using different input level density models.None of them have been found to agree with experiment. It manifests the seriousproblem with available level density parameterizations especially those basedon neutron resonance spacings and density of discrete levels. New leveldensities and corresponding Fermi-gas parameters have been obtained forreaction product nuclei such as 60Ni,60Co, and 57Fe.
  We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of theinteresting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting forthe different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleondynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)$\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained viasuitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effectof the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using thechiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) isincluded by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effectivefield theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with theprevious calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closedform analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses anddispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation andsuitable density expansion.
  The supersymmetric solutions of N=2, D=4 minimal ungauged and gaugedsupergravity are classified according to the fraction of preservedsupersymmetry using spinorial geometry techniques. Subject to a reasonableassumption in the 1/2-supersymmetric time-like case of the gauged theory, wederive the complete form of all supersymmetric solutions. This includes anumber of new 1/4- and 1/2-supersymmetric possibilities, like gravitationalwaves on bubbles of nothing in AdS_4.
  We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastablephases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by theparameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, asystem which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastablephases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleatecompetitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present ageneral method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleationrates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, whichpredicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when thenew phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rateof a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phasesaccessible from it.
  The entanglement entropy of the two-dimensional random transverse Ising modelis studied with a numerical implementation of the strong disorderrenormalization group. The asymptotic behavior of the entropy per surface areadiverges at, and only at, the quantum phase transition that is governed by aninfinite randomness fixed point. Here we identify a double-logarithmicmultiplicative correction to the area law for the entanglement entropy. Thiscontrasts with the pure area law valid at the infinite randomness fixed pointin the diluted transverse Ising model in higher dimensions.
  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when theenvelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of thedonor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipativeenvelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must beresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degeneratecomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-periodbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstructthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven moreproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, eitherduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced thefirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, commonenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massivewhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presentsinterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelopeevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usualformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The mostplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in thecommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budgetexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.
  Many water soluble polymers are chemically modified versions of insolublebase materials such as cellulose. A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determinethe effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of suchpolymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, withthe effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extremeblockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to apolymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for thesynthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisationof such systems.
  We observe coherent spin oscillations in an antiferromagnetic spin-1Bose-Einstein condensate of sodium. The variation of the spin oscillations withmagnetic field shows a clear signature of nonlinearity, in agreement withtheory, which also predicts anharmonic oscillations near a critical magneticfield. Measurements of the magnetic phase diagram agree with predictions madein the approximation of a single spatial mode. The oscillation period yieldsthe best measurement to date of the sodium spin-dependent interactioncoefficient, determining that the difference between the sodium spin-dependents-wave scattering lengths $a_{f=2}-a_{f=0}$ is $2.47\pm0.27$ Bohr radii.
  We study the thermodynamics of Kaluza-Klein black holes with momentum alongthe compact dimension, but vanishing angular momentum. These black holes arestationary, but non-rotating. We derive the first law for these spacetimes andfind that the parameter conjugate to variations in the length of the compactdirection is an effective tension, which generally differs from the ADMtension. For the boosted black string, this effective tension is alwayspositive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We alsoderive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,and a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry inthe compact dimension. Finally, we show that the `tension first law' derived byTraschen and Fox in the static case has the form of a thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhemrelation and give its extension in the stationary, non-rotating case.
  We show that plasmons in two-dimensional graphene can have net gain atterahertz frequencies. The coupling of the plasmons to interband electron-holetransitions in population inverted graphene layers can lead to plasmonamplification through the process of stimulated emission. We calculate plasmongain for different electron-hole densities and temperatures and show that thegain values can exceed $10^{4}$ cm$^{-1}$ in the 1-10 terahertz frequencyrange, for electron-hole densities in the $10^{9}$-$10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ range,even when plasmon energy loss due to intraband scattering is considered.Plasmons are found to exhibit net gain for intraband scattering times shorterthan 100 fs. Such high gain values could allow extremely compact terahertzamplifiers and oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 $\mu$m range.
  We give an extended review of recent work on the extended weak couplinglimit. Background material on completely positive semigroups and their unitarydilations is given, as well as a particularly easy construction of `quadraticnoises'.
  The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. Weanalyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgsbosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done bycombining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based onfull simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSMHiggs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenariosin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. Westudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_betaplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effectsarise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both viahigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays intosupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift theprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) byabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stablewith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within thediscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavyneutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% shouldbe achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSMparameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSMHiggs bosons at the LHC.
  We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with {\it Chandra X-RayObservatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our {\itChandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\it Chandra} dataobtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies ofSN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originatesfrom the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-likedense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor'sequatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is nowsweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A israpidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergss$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-componentplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. Asthe shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-rayremnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).
  Influence of hole shape on extraordinary optical transmission wasinvestigated using hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes with differentaspect ratio. It was found that the transmission could be tuned continuously byrotating the hole array. Further more, a phase was generated in this process,and linear polarization states could be changed to elliptical polarizationstates. This phase was correlated with the aspect ratio of the holes. Anintuitional model was presented to explain these results.
  It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation tothe requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using aquantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. Itis so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship betweenobserver and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values ofquantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more usefulfor systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantumcoherence.
  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) fromN-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can representsingularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-freenetworks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates ameta-fractal or "Sky" when it is interpreted as the "strut constant" (S) of anensemble of octahedral vertex figures called "Box-Kites" (the fundamentalbuilding blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or "recipes"provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the contextof Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.
  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically chargedPlanckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only bythe St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Herethe daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independentresult of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signalsobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind theSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as itmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well theiodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particlesfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentricorbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPboriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deginto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of theSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectoriestraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increasesthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.
  We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure thatquantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace.We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximallyentangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximallyentangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum errorcorrection codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and showthat the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code isa 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, weprovide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, weanalyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.
  Comprehensive x-ray scattering studies, including resonant scattering at MnL-edge, Tb L- and M-edges, were performed on single crystals of TbMn2O5. X-rayintensities were observed at a forbidden Bragg position in the ferroelectricphases, in addition to the lattice and the magnetic modulation peaks.Temperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between themodulation wave vectors provide direct evidences of exchange striction inducedferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence ofmultiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences.The commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributedto discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spinfrustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensuratephase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phasedomain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.
  In this paper we consider successive iterations of the first-orderdifferential operations in space ${\bf R}^3.$
  Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures innanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method.Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance innanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increaseof diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings thatthe temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature fordiameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. Thecalculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observablein nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermalconductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the correspondingvalue in bulk materials.
  Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistentwith General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a ScalarPotential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. TheSPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flowof IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshiftwithout an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) datawithout dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy centralvelocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests amodel of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of theuniverse. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of theSources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as betweenclusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distanceto a Source.
  We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations ofmatched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introducedin the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisitthe particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysisincludes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shellcosmologies.
  We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for thevelocity and pressure are both piecewise constant (colocated scheme). We use aprojection (fractional-step) method to deal with the incompressibilityconstraint. We prove that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokesequations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. Inparticular, we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. We infer from itthe stability of the scheme.
  Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for generalrelativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifyinggravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints dueto this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributionalsource. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential,and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. Weconstrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassinispacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always findingextremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Wediscuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmologicalacceleration.
  We search for galaxy counterparts to damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) atz>2 towards nine quasars, which have 14 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in their spectra.We use integral field spectroscopy to search for Ly-alpha emission line objectsat the redshifts of the absorption systems. Besides recovering two previouslyconfirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alphaemission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengthsclose to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. Incomparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies thecandidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsetsbetween the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impactparameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are foundat larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from theQSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find thatthe average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with anexponential scale length of ~5 kpc.
  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and thedescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand thediversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can beidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-typein the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopicobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate havebeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) usingthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have beenobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs inNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steepslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presenceof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens somequestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band hasnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detectedit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be causedby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer MainBelt.
  This work describes a new microfluidic device developed for rapid screeningof solubility diagrams. In several parallel channels, hundreds ofnanoliter-volume droplets of a given solution are first stored with a gradualvariation in the solute concentration. Then, the application of a temperaturegradient along these channels enables us to read directly and quantitativelyphase diagrams, concentration vs. temperature. We show, using a solution ofadipic acid, that we can measure ten points of the solubility curve in lessthan 1 hr and with only 250 $\mu$L of solution.
  We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochasticprocess with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis(MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In thisview we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges(1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to thosefor shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due tolong-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally wedetermine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tailhas more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.
  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discretedipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity arebounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, whenthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term issignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smallerthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear termdecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enoughscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numericalsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a numberof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.
  We consider a dilute gas of neutral unpolarized fermionic atoms at zerotemperature.The atoms interact via a short range (tunable) attractiveinteraction. We demonstrate analytically a curious property of the gas atunitarity. Namely, the correlation energy of the gas, evaluated by second orderperturbation theory, has the same density dependence as the first orderexchange energy, and the two almost exactly cancel each other at Feshbachresonance irrespective of the shape of the potential, provided $(\mu r_s) >>1$. Here $(\mu)^{-1}$ is the range of the two-body potential, and $r_s$ isdefined through the number density $n=3/(4\pi r_s^3)$. The implications of thisresult for universality is discussed.
  Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of theSeyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotatingdisk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures itfrom direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotatingdisk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To imagethe putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution tobetter understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the moleculargas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear regionof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images showno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to theradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separatefeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The westernfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocitycorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggestingthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongatednearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in thesame direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. Thisvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for theputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed moleculargas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by thejet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.
  By using tools of time-frequency analysis, we obtain some improved localwell-posedness results for the NLS, NLW and NLKG equations with Cauchy data inmodulation spaces $M{p, 1}_{0,s}$.
  Instead of using local field equations - like the Dirac equation for spin-1/2and the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to usenon-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latterequations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with thecorrespondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (andtaking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic couplingconstant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within theframework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering orfor the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for thescalar case. These results are then compared with the corresponding ones basedon the Klein-Gordon equation. A proposal of how to transfer these reflectionsto the spin-1/2 case is also presented.
  Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and thenexpands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is includedhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function oftransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC andLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in thepartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonicchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then theydissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occursvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octetccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There aremodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through thereactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large averagemomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermalstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with thesuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, abulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution andthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleoncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus anindicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest therapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be-3<y<3.
  Recently, it has been shown that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of theDresselhaus type in $[110]$ quantum wells can be mathematically removed by anon-Abelian gauge transformation. In the presence of an additional uniformmagnetic field, such a non-Abelian gauge flux leads to a spin accumulation atthe edges of the sample, where the relative sign of the spin accumulationbetween the edges can be tuned by the sign of the Dresselhaus SOC constant. Ourprediction can be tested by Kerr measurements within the available experimentalsensitivities.
  We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential whilethe atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. Thecoupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to themechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, candramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general thetunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters acollapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees offreedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atomposition, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. Theeffects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double welltrap.
  Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which contain magneticwhite dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve throughthe 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of theresulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs areknown, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolvedspectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as theIP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which containsa white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). Weestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 Gcm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmedshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggestthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towardsshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than theirorbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, withspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.
  Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin (WKB) approximation for fractional systems isinvestigated in this paper using the fractional calculus. In the fractionalcase the wave function is constructed such that the phase factor is the same asthe Hamilton's principle function "S". To demonstrate our proposed approach twoexamples are investigated in details.
  The Korea Invisible Mass Search(KIMS) experiment presents new limits onWIMP-nucleon cross section using the data from an exposure of 3409 kgd takenwith low background CsI(Tl) crystals at Yangyang underground laboratory. Themost stringent limit on the spin dependent interaction for pure proton case isobtained. The DAMA signal region for both spin independent and spin dependentinteractions for the WIMP mass higher than 20 GeV/c^2are excluded by the singleexperiment with crystal scintillators.
  We study the $D-\bar D$ mixing and rare D decays in the Littlest Higgs model.As the new weak singlet quark with the electric charge of 2/3 is introduced tocancel the quadratic divergence induced by the top-quark, the standard unitary$3\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is extended to a non-unitary$4\times 3$ matrix in the quark charged currents and Z-mediated flavor changingneutral currents are generated at tree level. In this model, we show that the$D-\bar D$ mixing parameter can be as large as the current experimental valueand the decay branching ratio (BR) of $D\to X_u \ga$ is small but its direct CPasymmetry could be $O(10%)$. In addition, we find that the BRs of $D\to X_u\ell^{+} \ell^{-}$, $D\to X_u\nu \bar \nu$ and $D\to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ could beenhanced to be $O(10^{-9})$, $O(10^{-8})$ and $O(10^{-9})$, respectively.
  We propose and study a model with glassy behavior. The state space of themodel is given by all triangulations of a sphere with $n$ nodes, half of whichare red and half are blue. Red nodes want to have 5 neighbors while blue oneswant 7. Energies of nodes with different numbers of neighbors are supposed tobe positive. The dynamics is that of flipping the diagonal of two adjacenttriangles, with a temperature dependent probability. We show that this systemhas an approach to a steady state which is exponentially slow, and show thatthe stationary state is unordered. We also study the local energy landscape andshow that it has the hierarchical structure known from spin glasses. Finally,we show that the evolution can be described as that of a rarefied gas withspontaneous generation of particles and annihilating collisions.
  Instanton liquid in heated and strongly interacting matter is studied usingthe variational principle. The dependence of the instanton liquid density(gluon condensate) on the temperature and the quark chemical potential isdetermined under the assumption that, at finite temperatures, the dominantcontribution is given by an ensemble of calorons. The respective one-loopeffective quark Lagrangian is used.
  The current status of the analysis of direct photon Bose-Einsteincorrelations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV done by the PHENIXcollaboration is summarized. All possible sources of distortion of thetwo-photon correlation function are discussed and methods to control them inthe PHENIX experiment are presented.
  This note is devoted to the definition of moduli spaces of rational tropicalcurves with n marked points. We show that this space has a structure of asmooth tropical variety of dimension n-3. We define the Deligne-Mumfordcompactification of this space and tropical $\psi$-class divisors.
  The doped two-dimensional quantum dimer model is investigated by numericaltechniques on the square and triangular lattices, with significantly differentresults. On the square lattice, at small enough doping, there is always a phaseseparation between an insulating valence-bond solid and a uniform superfluidphase, whereas on the triangular lattice, doping leads directly to a uniformsuperfluid in a large portion of the RVB phase. Under an applied Aharonov-Bohmflux, the superfluid exhibits quantization in terms of half-flux quanta,consistent with Q=2e elementary charge quanta in transport properties.
  Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build ageometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebraL of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide anexplicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L.This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for anatural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the studyof a rich and interesting algebraic structure.
  This lecture is devoted to the problem of computing initial data for theCauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity. The main task is to solve theconstraint equations. The conformal technique, introduced by Lichnerowicz andenhanced by York, is presented. Two standard methods, the conformaltransverse-traceless one and the conformal thin sandwich, are discussed andillustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initialdata for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given.
  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (notnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove aresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the termsof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finitedimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariantsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomologicalclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a giventype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classesand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have aplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents isimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growthrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class givessufficient "marching orders" to the system to prohibit the formation of anyother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamicalsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we giveconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheafcontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheafcohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identifiedwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both thesmooth and holomorphic setting.
  We describe preliminary results of a global model of the radiatively-drivenphotoionized wind and accretion flow of the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1.The full model combines FLASH hydrodynamic calculations, XSTAR photoionizationcalculations, HULLAC atomic data, and Monte Carlo radiation transport. Wepresent maps of the density, temperature, velocity, and ionization parameterfrom a FLASH two-dimensional time-dependent simulation of Vela X-1, as well asmaps of the emissivity distributions of the X-ray emission lines.
  We give details of the proof of the remark made in \cite{G2} that the Cherncharacters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group$SU_q(2)$ are not invariant under the natural $SU_q(2)$ coaction. Furthermore,the conjecture made in \cite{G2} about the nontriviality of the twisted Cherncharacter coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on $SU_q(2)$ issettled in the affirmative.
  The relative merits of current-spin-density- and spin-density-functionaltheory are investigated for solids treated within the exact-exchange-onlyapproximation. Spin-orbit splittings and orbital magnetic moments aredetermined at zero external magnetic field. We find that for magnetic (Fe, Coand Ni) and non-magnetic (Si and Ge) solids, the exact-exchangecurrent-spin-density functional approach does not significantly improve theaccuracy of the corresponding spin-density functional results.
  Efficient control of a laser welding process requires the reliable predictionof process behavior. A statistical method of field modeling, based onnormalized RBFNN, can be successfully used to predict the spatiotemporaldynamics of surface optical activity in the laser welding process. In thisarticle we demonstrate how to optimize RBFNN to maximize prediction quality.Special attention is paid to the structure of sample vectors, which representthe bridge between the field distributions in the past and future.
  A quantum protocol is described which enables a user to send sealed messagesand that allows for the detection of active eavesdroppers. We examine a classof eavesdropping strategies, those that make use of quantum operations, and wedetermine the information gain versus disturbance caused by these strategies.We demonstrate this tradeoff with an example and we compare this protocol toquantum key distribution, quantum direct communication, and quantum sealprotocols.
  We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-levelatoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distantcavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that aneffective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions.Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in thetwo cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating theengineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineeringenvironment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computationtogether has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shiftis implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of thedriving fields.
  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation ofgrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensationefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by thistension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dustformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the firsttime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation totheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sunstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, ontime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering bythe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smallergrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with thatderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating ofsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supportsthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be presentin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.
  Based on the formula for the number density of vacancies in a solid under thestress or tension, the model of grain boundary diffusion in crystalline solidsis developed. We obtain the activation energy of grain boundary diffusion(dependent on the surface tension or the energy of the grain boundary) and alsothe distributions of vacancies and the diffusing species in the vicinity of thegrain boundary.
  Let $G$ be a finite group and $V$ be a finite $G$--module. We present upperbounds for the cardinalities of certain subsets of $\Irr(GV)$, such as the setof those $\chi\in\Irr(GV)$ such that, for a fixed $v\in V$, the restriction of$\chi$ to $<v>$ is not a multiple of the regular character of $<v>$. Theseresults might be useful in attacking the non--coprime $k(GV)$--problem.
  We comment on the presence of a bimodality in the distribution of delay timebetween the formation of the progenitors and their explosion as type Ia SNe.Two "flavors" of such bimodality are present in the literature: a "weak"bimodality, in which type Ia SNe must explode from both young and oldprogenitors, and a "strong" bimodality, in which about half of the systemsexplode within 10^8 years from formation. The "weak" bimodality isobservationally based on the dependence of the rates with the host galaxy SFR,while the "strong" one on the different rates in radio-loud and radio-quietearly-type galaxies. We review the evidence for these bimodalities. Finally, weestimate the fraction of SNe which are missed by optical and near-IR searchesbecause of dust extinction in massive starbursts.
  We measure the decay constant fDs using the Ds -> l+ nu channel, where the l+designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+ -> pi+ nu. Using bothmeasurements we find fDs = 274 +-13 +- 7 MeV. Combining with our previousdetermination of fD+, we compute the ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. Wecompare with theoretical estimates.
  We first exhibit counterexamples to some open questions related to a theoremof Sakai.  Then we establish an extension theorem of Sakai type for separatelyholomorphic/meromorphic functions.
  Graphene multilayers are grown epitaxially on single crystal silicon carbide.This system is composed of several graphene layers of which the first layer iselectron doped due to the built-in electric field and the other layers areessentially undoped. Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particleproperties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and squareroot field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene showsquasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which maypersists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliatedgraphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxialgraphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localizedstates in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned usingstandard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array oftechniques. These favorable features indicate that interconnected roomtemperature ballistic devices may be feasible for low dissipation high-speednanoelectronics.
  We study more general variational problems on time scales. Previous resultsare generalized by proving necessary optimality conditions for (i) variationalproblems involving delta derivatives of more than the first order, and (ii)problems of the calculus of variations with delta-differential side conditions(Lagrange problem of the calculus of variations on time scales).
  We consider the variation of the surface spanned by closed strings in aspacetime manifold. Using the Nambu-Goto string action, we induce the geodesicsurface equation, the geodesic surface deviation equation which yields a Jacobifield, and we define the index form of a geodesic surface as in the case ofpoint particles to discuss conjugate strings on the geodesic surface.
  We demonstrate that radiative transitions with \Delta l = - 1 are stronglydominating for all values of n and l, except small region where l << n.
  We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of thedust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over acontinuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speedspectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that theoccultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTYradiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both theobserved occultation light curves and the spectral energy distributiondescribed in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius ofthe dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or thegradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamicoutflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming asubstantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially highermass-loss rate in the past.
  We study the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with therecently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph/0609105,hep-ph/0609090]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier resultof [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running couplingleads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. Therunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shapeof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to aconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of theevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations isdue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as thesubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluatenumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate thatwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained inthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We thenuse the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to findthe numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation withthe running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at verylarge rapidity.
  These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other)quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation inthe symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computationsfor weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of howorbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used tounderstand their topology. We then show how these results can be used tocompute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplecticreductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weightedprojective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention ofa stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.
  We present the theory of QED x QCD resummation and its interplay withshower/matrix element matching in precision LHC physics scenarios. Weillustrate the theory using single heavy gauge boson production at hadroncolliders.
  From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM)atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They areinsulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for theopposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic siliconnanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic momentand may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. Thespin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type ofdopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results arenot only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research onspintronic applications of silicon nanowires.
  The inter-Landau level transitions observed in far-infrared transmissionexperiments on few-layer graphene samples show a behaviour characteristic ofthe linear dispersion expected in graphene. This behaviour persists inrelatively thick samples, and is qualitatively different from that of thinsamples of bulk graphite.
  We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unitinterval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropyfunctional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respectto the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the intervalrespectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to constructtwo classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere orthe unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely relatedto Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is aprobability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsicmetric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as thecanonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.
  We present the latest catalog of more than 1200 spectroscopically-selectedclose binary systems observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through DataRelease Five. We use the catalog to search for magnetic white dwarfs incataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% ofcataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sampleof close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmicvariables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magneticwhite dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that aresimilar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the averagefield strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations ofthese systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magneticwhite dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between theproperties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and thepresumed close binary progenitors.
  The fundamental knowledge on neutrinos acquired in the recent years open thepossibility of applied neutrino physics. Among it the automatic and nonintrusive monitoring of nuclear reactor by its antineutrino signal could bevery valuable to IAEA in charge of the control of nuclear power plants. Severalefforts worldwide have already started.
  Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetricrequires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probingtheir spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at theCERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pairproduction with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus thelightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extradimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark fromsupersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channelprovides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom productionrate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino aresufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.
  Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinningin superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that avariety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer andfractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arraysproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the criticaldepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaksat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located inthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycombpinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillingsB/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recentexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generallyoccur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronouncedmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At thenoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, theinterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-merstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states"vortex molecular crystals" and "vortex plastic crystals" since they aresimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common withcertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show thatkagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the criticalcurrent above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.
  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project is a survey forplanetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a small-aperture, wide-fieldautomated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. Thetelescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25%of the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching fortransits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware andsoftware and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT isable to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetarytransits around solar-type main sequence stars.
  The Schrodinger motion of a charged quantum particle in an electromagneticpotential can be simulated by the paraxial dynamics of photons propagatingthrough a spatially inhomogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity induces geometriceffects that generate an artificial vector potential to which signal photonsare coupled. This phenomenon can be implemented with slow light propagatingthrough an a gas of double-Lambda atoms in an electromagnetically-inducedtransparency setting with spatially varied control fields. It can lead to areduced dispersion of signal photons and a topological phase shift ofAharonov-Bohm type.
  The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalizedin a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids,called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partialfunctions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connectionswith circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1}and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and Dare characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntzalgebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over anyfinite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certaininfinite generating sets.  Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errorshave been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change.Sections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, whichwas incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference[6], and is also given here.
  Simple examples are constructed that show the entanglement of two qubitsbeing both increased and decreased by interactions on just one of them. One ofthe two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangledor correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled,but becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangledqubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled toseparable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the twoqubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the stateof the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of twoindependent interactions that individually give exponential decay of theentanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but,instead, go to zero at a finite time.
  We show a one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of d lines in theprojective plane, and lines in P^{d-2}. We apply this correspondence toclassify (3,q)-nets over the complex numbers for all q<=6. When q=6, we havetwelve possible combinatorial cases, but we prove that only nine of them arerealizable. This new case shows several new properties for 3-nets: differentdimensions for moduli, strict realization over certain fields, etc. We alsoconstruct a three dimensional family of (3,8)-nets corresponding to theQuaternion group.
  The Ca II infrared triplet is one of the few magnetically sensitivechromospheric lines available for ground-based observations. We presentspectropolarimetric observations of the 8498 A and 8542 A lines in a quiet Sunregion near a decaying active region and compare the results with a simulationof the lines in a high plasma-beta regime. Cluster analysis of Stokes V profilepairs shows that the two lines, despite arguably being formed fairly close,often do not have similar shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topologyis more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than thephase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find thatStokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of theobserved amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from thesimulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory behavior in theCa II lines. It is stronger in the network, where shocking waves, similar tothose in the high-beta simulation, are seen and large self-reversals in theintensity profiles are common.
  We relate a generic character sheaf on a disconnected reductive group with acharacter of a representation of the rational points of the group over a finitefield extending a result known in the connected case.
  We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radiofrequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and atime dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass isshown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabaticallyevolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found todepend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of theatomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field,including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided forseveral recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizingadiabatic rf potentials.
  In this contribution we go through the developments that in the years 1968 to1974 led from the Veneziano model to the bosonic string.
  A recent polarized x-ray absorption experiment on the high temperaturecuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 indicates the presence of broken paritysymmetry below the temperature, T*, where a pseudogap appears in photoemission.We critically analyze the x-ray data, and conclude that a parity-breakingsignal of the kind suggested is unlikely based on the crystal structuresreported in the literature. Possible other origins of the observed dichroismsignal are discussed. We propose x-ray scattering experiments that can be donein order to determine whether such alternative interpretations are valid ornot.
  Triangular Lie algebras are the Lie algebras which can be faithfullyrepresented by triangular matrices of any finite size over the real/complexnumber field. In the paper invariants ('generalized Casimir operators') arefound for three classes of Lie algebras, namely those which are either strictlyor non-strictly triangular, and for so-called special upper triangular Liealgebras. Algebraic algorithm of [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2006, V.39, 5749;math-ph/0602046], developed further in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2007, V.40,113; math-ph/0606045], is used to determine the invariants. A conjecture of [J.Phys. A: Math. Gen., 2001, V.34, 9085], concerning the number of independentinvariants and their form, is corroborated.
  The expansion of the Universe is accelerating, as testified by observationsof supernovae of type Ia as a function of redshift. Explanations are of twotypes: modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy, coined darkenergy.The accelerated expansion is explained here by a combination ofDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model gravity and Chaplygin gas dark energy. Bothmodels are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. Thecontinuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, andsolved by numerical methods. The solution is shown to have the expectedproperties: at very small scales (a<<L) the energy density behaves aspressureless dust, at very large scales (a>>L) as a cosmological constant. Themodifications to the DGP model and the Chaplygin gas model occur for values ofa L. The results show an increase in the present dark energy density relativeto the plain DGP model.
  We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensionalorganic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to thestacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulatortransition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra showa Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in theoptical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrationsgives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below thetransition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of thelattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a newinfrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, whichhas so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing ametal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling betweenthe TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole momentof the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior ofthe new mode.
  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one ofthe two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. Byanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverseproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probablycreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and thecorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape ofthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that theUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the threeforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV backgroundmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metalline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraintson the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasarsshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening ofthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also inoverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiativetransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observedspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect ofQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
  We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micronaround the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the JamesClerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust diskaround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micronflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makesthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the diskreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris diskdetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightlyyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require thedisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which thedust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperaturesaccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as amodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperaturesaccording to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks inthe TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses ofdisks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.debris) as a function of spectral type.
  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the latticeBoltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations withoutblurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do thesame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumesand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the constructionof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalarquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy "trimming") and (ii)based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physicalproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropyproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation arepossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-drivencavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropicquasiequilibria.
  We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differentialgeometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition whichimplies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem isformulated for a compact K\"ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space ofharmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\"ahler metric.We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectralsequence.
  In this paper we give a generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and usingthis we describe the M\"obius function of the generalized subword order from aposet {a1,...as,c |ai<c}, which contains an affirmative answer for theconjecture by Bj\"orner, Sagan, Vatter.[5,10]
  We present the fourth edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QuasarCatalog. The catalog contains 77,429 objects; this is an increase of over30,000 entries since the previous edition. The catalog consists of the objectsin the SDSS Fifth Data Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0(in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7)have at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s, or haveinteresting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i=15.0, and havehighly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is 5740 sq. deg. Thequasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; thecatalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are atredshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positionsaccurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on themorphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover thewavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000. The spectracan be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in thecatalog. The average SDSS colors of quasars as a function of redshift, derivedfrom the catalog entries, are presented in tabular form. Approximately 96% ofthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS.
  The line of sight to the quasar B0218+357, one of the most studied lensedsystems, intercepts a z=0.68 spiral galaxy, which splits its image into twomain components A and B, separated by ca. 0.3'', and gives rise to molecularabsorption. Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise infront of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from othervelocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle thisquestion, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during thecommissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau deBure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as afunction of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowedus to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component.Our results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components ofthe HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of thequasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.
  We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglementbetween spins on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice can bequalitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exactdiagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime offully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gapin the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gapare discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model.
  We consider effective model where photons interact with scalar fieldcorresponding to conformal excitations of the internal space (geometricalmoduli/gravexcitons). We demonstrate that this interaction results in amodified dispersion relation for photons, and consequently, the photon groupvelocity depends on the energy implying the propagation time delay effect. Wesuggest to use the experimental bounds of the time delay of gamma ray bursts(GRBs) photons propagation as an additional constrain for the gravexcitonparameters.
  We prove that the limit hypersurfaces of converging curvature flows arestable, if the initial velocity has a weak sign, and give a survey of theexistence and regularity results.
  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a ratherunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knotsare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to proteinfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete ProteinData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discoveredones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the mostcomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest thatits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by theproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species andsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which onlyappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins ofsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in theenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of ashort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into aknotted structure in this protein.
  We study phonon-mediated transitions between translational levels of an atomin a surface-induced potential. We present a general master equation governingthe dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of theDebye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward anddownward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates areperformed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number ofbound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rateis shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deepbound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders ofmagnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, forthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400$\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, theadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than theheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-freedownward decay) rate is negligible.
  We consider a two-brane system in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitterspacetime. We study particle creation due to the motion of the physical branewhich first approaches the second static brane (contraction) and then recedesfrom it(expansion). The spectrum and the energy density of the generatedgravitons are calculated. We show that the massless gravitons have a bluespectrum and that their energy density satisfies the nucleosynthesis bound withvery mild constraints on the parameters. We also show that the Kaluza-Kleinmodes cannot provide the dark matter in an anti-de-Sitter braneworld. However,for natural choices of parameters, backreaction from the Kaluza-Klein gravitonsmay well become important. The main findings of this work have been publishedin the form of a Letter [R. Durrer and M. Ruser, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 071601(2007), arXiv:0704.0756].
  We consider a design for a cyclic microrefrigerator using a superconductingflux qubit. Adiabatic modulation of the flux combined with thermalization canbe used to transfer energy from a lower temperature normal metal thin filmresistor to another one at higher temperature. The frequency selectivity ofphotonic heat conduction is achieved by including the hot resistor as part of ahigh frequency LC resonator and the cold one as part of a low-frequencyoscillator while keeping both circuits in the underdamped regime. We discussthe performance of the device in an experimentally realistic setting. Thisdevice illustrates the complementarity of information and thermodynamic entropyas the erasure of the quantum bit directly relates to the cooling of theresistor.
  We describe the maximal torus and maximal unipotent subgroup of the Picardvariety of a proper scheme over a perfect field.
  Alexander B. Medvinsky \emph{et al} [A. B. Medvinsky, I. A. Tikhonova, R. R.Aliev, B.-L. Li, Z.-S. Lin, and H. Malchow, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{64}, 021915(2001)] and Marcus R. Garvie \emph{et al} [M. R. Garvie and C. Trenchea, SIAMJ. Control. Optim. \textbf{46}, 775-791 (2007)] shown that the minimalspatially extended reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton-zooplankton canexhibit both regular, chaotic behavior, and spatiotemporal patterns in a patchyenvironment. Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherlyinvestigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in thepresent paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixedTuring-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist inthat region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-fieldbreakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients ofphytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising fromthe far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the wholespace within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computationspectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains. Finally, we give someexplanations about the spatially structured patterns from the community level.
  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches innon-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond thestandard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search ofneutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of theprocess of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very firstexperiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existenceof possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoingefforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majoranaexperiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailedstudy of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.
  The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in apercolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor containspercolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clustersof a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structureis YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Agsheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transitionof the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolationtransition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vorticesare free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractaldimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transportcurrent are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glasstype is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltagecharacteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained andtheir features are studied.
  Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples ofAl-2.5%Mg alloy at room temperature in a wide range of strain rates where thePortevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed. The experimental stress-timeseries data have been analyzed using the recurrence analysis technique based onthe Recurrence Plot (RP) and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) tostudy the change in the dynamical behavior of the PLC effect with the imposedstrain rate. Our study revealed that the RQA is able to detect the uniquecrossover phenomenon in the PLC dynamics.
  The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared lineobservations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical andchemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. Wepresent a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecularlines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibriumcalculations involving collisional and radiative processes and includingradiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with anescape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web athttp://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use ofmolecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database(LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance ofthe program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticatedmethods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parametersfrom line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program shouldform an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radioand infrared telescopes.
  We extend the calculable analytic approach to marginal deformations recentlydeveloped in open bosonic string field theory to open superstring field theoryformulated by Berkovits. We construct analytic solutions to all orders in thedeformation parameter when operator products made of the marginal operator andthe associated superconformal primary field are regular.
  I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) thatthere exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans.I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it impliesthe Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is anabstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH andMUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreduciblerepresentations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions tobroader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness.I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structuresexist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain whyour physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relationbetween mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physicalsystems.
  We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermalradio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar windnebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties ofthis source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-rayemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by apower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, theX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller thanthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantlyoffset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia TelescopeCompact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes RadioTelescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though someareas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral indexof ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar ofL_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of theseobservational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or alarge PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic modelfor the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, weconclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebulaformed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in alow density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.
  In this letter, we consider the constraints imposed by the recent measurementof B_s - bar B_s mixing on the new physics contribution to the rare decay B_s--> mu+ mu-. New physics in the form vector and axial-vector couplings isalready severely constrained by the data on B --> (K,K*) mu+ mu-. Here, we showthat B_s - bar B_s mixing data, together with the data on K0 - bar K0 mixingand K_L --> mu+ mu- decay rate, strongly constrain the scalar-pseudoscalarcontribution to B_s --> mu+ mu-. We conclude that new physics can at best leadto a factor of 2 increase in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- compared toits Standard Model expectation.
  We present mid-infrared (10.4 \micron, 11.7 \micron, and 18.3 \micron)imaging intended to locate and characterize the suspected protostellarcomponents within the Bok globule CB54. We detect and confirm the protostellarstatus for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity forCB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \approx 8 L_\sun$, and we estimate acentral source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection isconsistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or Bstar or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I isthat the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely highinclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the centralprotostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which arespatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The sourcetemperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with thedense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0protostars.
  Erd\"{o}s and Tur\'{a}n once conjectured that any set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$with $\sum_{a\in A}{1}/{a}=\infty$ should contain infinitely many progressionsof arbitrary length $k\geq3$. For the two-dimensional case Graham conjecturedthat if $B\subset \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $$\sum\limits_{(x,y)\inB}\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}=\infty,$$ then for any $s\geq2$, $B$ contains an $s\timess$ axes-parallel grid. In this paper it is shown that if the Graham conjectureis true for some $s\geq2$, then the Erd\"{o}s-Tur\'{a}n conjecture is true for$k=2s-1$.
  We propose a new concept for the design of high-efficiency photocells basedon ultra-thin (submicron) semiconductor films of controlled thickness. Using amicroscopic model of a thin dielectric layer interacting with incidentelectromagnetic radiation we evaluate the efficiency of conversion of solarradiation into the electric power. We determine the optimal range of parameterswhich maximize the efficiency of such photovoltaic element.
  We introduce VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims torecover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from syntheticmodels. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recoverreliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal isrobustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designedto return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper wedetail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to syntheticand real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that thenumber of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly onthe signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a youngpopulation. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recoverbetween 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPAand our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.
  Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of thesimple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrixare studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simpleLie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrownand superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix ofrank 2 are classified.
  We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatiallyand temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approachis based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffuselyreflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. Byperiodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensembleaverages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamicactivity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the differentstages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we canaccess ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as tenmicrometers over the full field of view.
  We present a $^{63,65}$Cu and $^{29}$Si NMR study of the quasi-2D coupledspin 1/2 dimer compound BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ in the magnetic field range 13-26 T andat temperatures as low as 50 mK. NMR data in the gapped phase reveal that below90 K different intra-dimer exchange couplings and different gaps($\Delta_{\rm{B}}/\Delta_{\rm{A}}$ = 1.16) exist in every second plane alongthe c-axis, in addition to a planar incommensurate (IC) modulation. $^{29}$Sispectra in the field induced magnetic ordered phase reveal that close to thequantum critical point at $H_{\rm{c1}}$ = 23.35 T the average boson density$\bar{n}$ of the Bose-Einstein condensate is strongly modulated along thec-axis with a density ratio for every second plane$\bar{n}_{\rm{A}}/\bar{n}_{\rm{B}} \simeq 5$. An IC modulation of the localdensity is also present in each plane. This adds new constraints for theunderstanding of the 2D value $\phi$ = 1 of the critical exponent describingthe phase boundary.
  This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitionsof the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of thecodons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracypattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.
  We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the firstround of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. Weimplemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherentpre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain MonteCarlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signaldetection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increasedin accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signalparameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate thatthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determineaccurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.
  We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrizationinvariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems.We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. Wedescribe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be testednumerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explainedby other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal.We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3dEdwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideasapply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up topresent.
  In the first section of this paper we prove a theorem for the number ofcolumns of a rectangular area that are identical to the given one. In the nextsection we apply this theorem to derive several combinatorial identities bycounting specified subsets of a finite set.

  In this article, we describe explicitely the Gorenstein locus of allminuscule Schubert varieties. This proves a special case of a conjecture of A.Woo and A. Yong (see math.AG/0603273) on the Gorenstein locus of Schubertvarieties.
  We review the recently discovered connection between theBelinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like ``chaotic'' structure of genericcosmological singularities in eleven-dimensional supergravity and the ``last''hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E(10). This intriguing connection suggests theexistence of a hidden ``correspondence'' between supergravity (or evenM-theory) and null geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional coset spaceK(E(10)). If true, this gravity/coset correspondence would offer a new view ofthe (quantum) fate of space (and matter) at cosmological singularities.
  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of apoint mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion inthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surfacedensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particlemotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for afinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how thesedifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, weinvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find thatsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energyspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite differentfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. Thissuggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours ofthe orbit via the gravitational waves.
  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (inwhich the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita$\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some localprojectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations inwhich only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between thebimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Moritasemi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data willbe used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establishequivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategoriesof modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules andinjective right wide Morita contexts.
  We present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148 extragalactic radiosources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), anduse these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scalestructure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes ofthese RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with thelocations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries thepresence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galacticquadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we considerall available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, andjointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field followsthe spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourthGalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise inthe Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directedcounter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recentpulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMsdemonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are notrequired to account for observations.
  The current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics of break junctions ofpolycrystalline La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$,Y$_{0.75}$Lu$_{0.25}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$,Bi$_{1.8}$Pb$_{0.3}$Sr$_{1.9}$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ and compositeYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ + Ag are investigated. The experimental $I$-$V$curves exhibit the specific peculiarities ofsuperconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions. The relation between an$I$-$V$ characteristic of network of weak links and $I$-$V$ dependencies oftypical weak links is suggested to describe the experimental data. The $I$-$V$curves of typical weak links are calculated by the K\"{u}mmel - Gunsenheimer -Nicolsky model considering the multiple Andreev reflections.
  The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, insemiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approachfor different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Variousmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, theDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phononinteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling dueto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of theelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfineinteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spindecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, thespin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have markedeffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studyingboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, eitherin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finitetemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from theFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at hightemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use theequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spindephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.
  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter fieldfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agreeswith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of theMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossilevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggeststhat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of theEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived fromEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predictsthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rateabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).
  A combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) computersimulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by thelong-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LCmethod yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments weredone in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination ofboth self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime aswell. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. Inthe temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient islarger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows thatthis difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can berefered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamicfactor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force forinterdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is agood approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamiccross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range underconsideration.
  When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation isrotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to thetransmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena byextending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. Wefind that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotatingmedium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angularmomentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentumaccount respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation ofthe transmitted image.
  We lead the algorithm of expansion of sojourn probability of many-dimensionaldiffusion processes in small domain. The principal member of this expansiondefines normalizing coefficient for special limit theorems.
  Hourglass is the name given here to a formal isolated quantum system that canradiate. Starting from a time when it defines the system it represents clearlyand no radiation is present, it is given straightforward Hamiltonian evolution.The question of what significance hourglasses have is raised, and this questionis proposed to be more consequential than the measurement problem.
  A unified approach to (symmetric informationally complete) positive operatorvalued measures and mutually unbiased bases is developed in this article. Theapproach is based on the use of operator equivalents expanded in the envelopingalgebra of SU(2). Emphasis is put on similarities and differences betweenSIC-POVMs and MUBs.
  It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallelconcatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor thanthat of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns canonly be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towardslow bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of arate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, wepresent and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which wecall pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rateperformance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that oftheir rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results tosimulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards theerror floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematicoutput. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means ofimproving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering itserror floor.
  In trigonometric series terms all polyharmonic functions inside the unit diskare described. For such functions it is proved the existence of their boundaryvalues on the unit circle in the space of hyperfunctions. The necessary andsufficient conditions are presented for the boundary value to belong to certainsubspaces of the space of hyperfunctions.
  We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates indifferent spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individualmeasurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transversedirections, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially,this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide randomresults. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect ofthe successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situationwhere all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number ofmeasurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effectsshow up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. Theviolation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins maybe comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.
  We experimentally demonstrate controlled polarization-selective phenomena ina whispering gallery mode resonator. We observed efficient ($\approx 75 %$)polarization conversion of light in a silica microsphere coupled to a taperedoptical fiber with proper optimization of the polarization of the propagatinglight. A simple model treating the microsphere as a ring resonator provides agood fit to the observed behavior.
  How to effectively solve the eigen solutions of the nonlinear spinor fieldequation coupling with some other interaction fields is important to understandthe behavior of the elementary particles. In this paper, we derive a simplifiedform of the eigen equation of the nonlinear spinor, and then propose a schemeto solve their numerical solutions. This simplified equation has elegant andneat structure, which is more convenient for both theoretical analysis andnumerical computation.
  We investigate the generation of quantum operations for one-qubit systemsunder classical noise with 1/f^\alpha power spectrum, where 2>\alpha > 0. Wepresent an efficient way to approximate the noise with a discrete multi-stateMarkovian fluctuator. With this method, the average temporal evolution of thequbit density matrix under 1/f^\alpha noise can be feasibly determined fromrecently derived deterministic master equations. We obtain qubit operationssuch as quantum memory and the NOT}gate to high fidelity by a gradient basedoptimization algorithm. For the NOT gate, the computed fidelities arequalitatively similar to those obtained earlier for random telegraph noise. Inthe case of quantum memory however, we observe a nonmonotonic dependency of thefidelity on the operation time, yielding a natural access rate of the memory.
  The parsimony score of a character on a tree equals the number of statechanges required to fit that character onto the tree. We show that forunordered, reversible characters this score equals the number of treerearrangements required to fit the tree onto the character. We discussimplications of this connection for the debate over the use of consensus treesor total evidence, and show how it provides a link between incongruence ofcharacters and recombination.
  We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass functionusing (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and theSersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured(spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium GalaxyCatalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass functionwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxysample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. Theuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which includeuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, thegalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassiveblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up insupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.
  We study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model[with a random-exchange probability $P(J_{xy}) = p \delta(J_{xy} - J) + (1-p)\delta(J_{xy} + J)$] at the transition line between the paramagnetic andferromagnetic phase, which extends from $p=1$ to a multicritical (Nishimori)point at $p=p_N\approx 0.767$. By a finite-size scaling analysis of Monte Carlosimulations at various values of $p$ in the region $p_N<p<1$, we provide strongnumerical evidence that the critical behavior along the ferromagnetictransition line belongs to the same universality class as the three-dimensionalrandomly-dilute Ising model. We obtain the results $\nu=0.682(3)$ and$\eta=0.036(2)$ for the critical exponents, which are consistent with theestimates $\nu=0.683(2)$ and $\eta=0.036(1)$ at the transition ofrandomly-dilute Ising models.
  Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursivesampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multipleProjects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probabilitydistributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probabilitydistributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options onschedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied todevelop a relative risk analysis among projects.
  We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomicinteraction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed infirst-principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large-scale atomisticsimulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe thefundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility inadapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing itslimitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effectivepotentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals.
  This paper has been removed by arXiv administrators because it plagiarizesgr-qc/0410004, gr-qc/0603075, and others.  This paper also has excessive overlap with the following papers also writtenby the authors or their collaborators: gr-qc/0608111, and others.
  We compare the mass distribution of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN)with those of their progeny, white dwarfs (WD). We use a dynamical method tomeasure masses with an uncertainty of 0.02 M$_\odot$. The CSPN massdistribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaksat lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution isfaster than predicted by the Bl\"ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WDmay avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannotbe fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened byobservational or model uncertainties.
  The nature of quantum criticality in CeCoIn$_5$ is studied by low-temperaturethermal expansion $\alpha(T)$. At the field-induced quantum critical point atH=5 T a crossover scale $T^\star\approx 0.3$ K is observed, separating$\alpha(T)/T\propto T^{-1}$ from a weaker $T^{-1/2}$ divergence. We ascribethis change to a crossover in the dimensionality of the critical fluctuationswhich may be coupled to a change from unconventional to conventional quantumcriticality. Disorder, whose effect on quantum criticality is studied inCeCoIn$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ ($0\leq x\leq 0.18$), shifts $T^\star$ towards highertemperatures.
  We report a measurement of D0-D0bar mixing in D0->Ks pi+ pi- decays using atime-dependent Dalitz plot analysis. We first assume CP conservation andsubsequently allow for CP violation. The results are based on 540 fb$^{-1}$ ofdata accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider.Assuming negligible CP violation, we measure the mixing parameters$x=(0.80\pm0.29^{+0.09 +0.10}_{-0.07 -0.14})%$ and $y=(0.33\pm0.24^{+0.08+0.06}_{-0.12 -0.08})%$, where the errors are statistical, experimentalsystematic, and systematic due to the Dalitz decay model, respectively.Allowing for CP violation, we obtain the $CPV$ parameters $|q/p|=0.86^{+0.30+0.06}_{-0.29 -0.03}\pm0.08$ and $\arg(q/p)=(-14^{+16 +5 +2}_{-18 -3-4})^\circ$.
  In this paper, we briefly present our work on the role of transition-metalelement in electronic structure and transport properties of quasicrystals andrelated complex phases. Several Parts of these works have been done orinitiated in collaboration with Prof. T. Fujiwara.
  Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data arereduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University andarchived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). Thedata-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably overthe lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently beenreprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paperdescribes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, andthe format of the resulting calibrated data files.
  We prove that the set of limit groups is recursive, answering a question ofDelzant. One ingredient of the proof is the observation that a finitelypresented group with local retractions (a la Long and Reid) is coherent and,furthermore, there exists an algorithm that computes presentations for finitelygenerated subgroups. The other main ingredient is the ability toalgorithmically calculate centralizers in relatively hyperbolic groups.Applications include the existence of recognition algorithms for limit groupsand free groups.
  We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly.Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen inpredictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclearsystem passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are ableto pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies whenthey appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physicsaddressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters inthe canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grandcanonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to theissue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment inboth canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that thisdistribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. Therelationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.
  We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phononat the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one ofthe inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is mostpronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Ramanspectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and(-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure thestrength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factordependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized latticemodes.
  The effective potential analysis indicates that, in a 3D two-flavorGross-Neveu model in vacuum, depending on less or bigger than the criticalvalue 2/3 of $G_S/H_P$, where $G_S$ and $H_P$ are respectively the couplingconstants of scalar quark-antiquark channel and pseudoscalar diquark channel,the system will have the ground state with pure diquark condensates or withpure quark-antiquark condensates, but no the one with coexistence of the twoforms of condensates. The similarities and differences in the interplay betweenthe quark-antiquark and the diquark condensates in vacuum in the 2D, 3D and 4Dtwo-flavor four-fermion interaction models are summarized.
  We describe results of a narrow band search for ultra-strong emission linegalaxies (USELs) with EW(H beta) > 30 A. 542 candidate galaxies are found in ahalf square degree survey using two ~100 Angstrom 8150 A and 9140 A filterswith Subaru/SuprimeCam. Followup spectroscopy for randomly selected objects inthe sample with KeckII/DEIMOS shows they consist of [OIII] 5007, [OII] 3727,and H alpha selected strong-emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z< 1), and Ly alpha emitting galaxies at high-redshift (z >> 5). We determinethe H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs,which is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1,suggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at theseredshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral linesand about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal PoorGalaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yieldrate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.The lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06(6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. Theluminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistentwith the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggestthat galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z <1.
  The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a largecircular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consistingof two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scalestructures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission ofthe NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passesclose to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles.It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced byinteraction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers ofthe shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.
  Let $\Gamma =(V,E)$ be a point-symmetric reflexive relation and let $v\in V$such that  $|\Gamma (v)|$ is finite (and hence $|\Gamma (x)|$ is finite for all $x$, bythe transitive action of the group of automorphisms). Let $j\in \N$ be aninteger such that $\Gamma ^j(v)\cap \Gamma ^{-}(v)=\{v\}$. Our main resultstates that  $$ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)|\ge | \Gamma ^{j-1} (v)| + |\Gamma (v)|-1.$$  As an application we have $ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)| \ge 1+(|\Gamma (v)|-1)j.$ Thelast result confirms a recent conjecture of Seymour in the case ofvertex-symmetric graphs. Also it gives a short proof for the validity of theCaccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture for vertex-symmetric graphs and generalizes anadditive result of Shepherdson.
  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take eventparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstandinginfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvableby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one orderhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedlesscone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The onlyexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making itunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading tocode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpointimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of ananalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton andhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedlessalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly throughreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for somemulti-jet observables.
  We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes fromtheir near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing thegravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal blackholes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges ofappropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations areprovided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimalgauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black holesolutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and theirrelations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of thenear-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.
  Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonicmolecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numericallyinvestigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interactiondepending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PMparameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths andQ-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way tofabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directionalemission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors thanpreviously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identicalmicroresonators.
  A stochastic action principle for stochastic dynamics is revisited. Wepresent first numerical diffusion experiments showing that the diffusion pathprobability depend exponentially on average Lagrangian action. This result isthen used to derive an uncertainty measure defined in a way mimicking the heator entropy in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the pathuncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information andthat the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classicalmechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this actionprinciple, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of themechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.
  This paper deals with discrete-time Markov control processes on a generalstate space. A long-run risk-sensitive average cost criterion is used as aperformance measure. The one-step cost function is nonnegative and possiblyunbounded. Using the vanishing discount factor approach, the optimalityinequality and an optimal stationary strategy for the decision maker areestablished.
  We analytically calculate to second order the correction to the asymptoticform of quasinormal frequencies of four dimensional Schwarzschild black holesbased on the monodromy analysis proposed by Motl and Neitzke. Our results arein good agreement with those obtained from numerical calculation.
  The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nuehas been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoreticalcalculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at thePEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction,relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0--> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From theseresults, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), thenormalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/-0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic,and from external inputs, respectively.
  A complete set of polarization transfer observables has been measured for the$^{12}{\rm C}(p,n)$ reaction at $T_p=296 {\rm MeV}$ and $\theta_{\rmlab}=0^{\circ}$. The total spin transfer $\Sigma(0^{\circ})$ and the observable$f_1$ deduced from the measured polarization transfer observables indicate thatthe spin--dipole resonance at $E_x \simeq 7 {\rm MeV}$ has greater $2^-$strength than $1^-$ strength, which is consistent with recent experimental andtheoretical studies. The results also indicate a predominance of the spin-flipand unnatural-parity transition strength in the continuum. The exchange tensorinteraction at a large momentum transfer of $Q \simeq 3.6 {\rm fm}^{-1}$ isdiscussed.
  I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediatecoupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use anextended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatialfluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close tohalf-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wavesuperconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of bothvertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction ofa d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulombpseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporarysuperconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destructionof the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.
  We show that the cold atom systems of simultaneously trapped Bose-Einsteincondensates (BEC's) and quantum degenerate fermionic atoms provide promisinglaboratories for the study of macroscopic quantum tunneling. Our theoreticalstudies reveal that the spatial extent of a small trapped BEC immersed in aFermi sea can tunnel and coherently oscillate between the values of theseparated and mixed configurations (the phases of the phase separationtransition of BEC-fermion systems). We evaluate the period, amplitude anddissipation rate for $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K-atoms and we discuss theexperimental prospects for observing this phenomenon.
  The density dependence of the symmetry energy in the equation of state ofisospin asymmetric nuclear matter is of significant importance for studying thestructure of systems as diverse as the neutron-rich nuclei and the neutronstars. A number of reactions using the dynamical and the statistical models ofmultifragmentation, and the experimental isoscaling observable, is studied toextract information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. It isobserved that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations giveconsistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model tobe small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made toobtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of thesymmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely " stiff " and " soft "form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with importantimplications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.
  Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities.Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space ofmoduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational mapfrom W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D,to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number ofmoduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect tothe moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In thispaper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduliexactly equal to seven.
  Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCS) based on the nonlinearoptical response of excitons to sequences of ultrafast pulses, has thepotential to provide some unique insights into carrier dynamics insemiconductors. The most prominent feature of 2DCS, cross peaks, can best beunderstood using a sum-over-states picture involving the many-body eigenstates.However, the optical response of semiconductors is usually calculated bysolving truncated equations of motion for dynamical variables, which result ina quasiparticle picture. In this work we derive Green's function expressionsfor the four wave mixing signals generated in various phase-matching directionsand use them to establish the connection between the two pictures. The formalconnection with Frenkel excitons (hard-core bosons) and vibrational excitons(soft-core bosons) is pointed out.
  The recent analyses of the following rare vector-vector decays of the B mesonare presented: rho K*, omega K*, omega rho, omega omega, and omega phicharmless final states. The latest results indicate that the fraction oflongitudinal polarization is about 0.5 in penguin-dominated modes and close to1 for tree-dominated modes.
  We evaluate the Coulomb drag current in two finite-lengthTomonaga-Luttinger-liquid wires coupled by an electrostatic backscatteringinteraction. The drag current in one wire shows oscillations as a function ofthe bias voltage applied to the other wire, reflecting interferences of theplasmon standing waves in the interacting wires. In agreement with thispicture, the amplitude of the current oscillations is reduced with increasingtemperature. This is a clear signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics because forcoupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as thetemperature is raised.
  Simulations of physicists for the competition between adult languages since2003 are reviewed. How many languages are spoken by how many people? How manylanguages are contained in various language families? How do languagesimilarities decay with geographical distance, and what effects do naturalboundaries have? New simulations of bilinguality are given in an appendix.
  The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important rolefor present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain,using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalarform factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is largerthan the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`esequations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between bothvalues, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method andshow that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor undertiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor forsome S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, theresulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of errorin our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-waveI=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the notyet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor fromQCD.
  Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphenelayers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrastto earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to thesubstrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrumobserved experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing grapheneappears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waalsbonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interfaceis metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for singleor double graphene coverage, respectively.
  The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains severalpotential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission and two as yetunidentified high-energy EGRET sources. Sensitive VHE observations are requiredto probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope arrayhas been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region.CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in theregion, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production viahadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source,HESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source isunresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but ispossibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, theBe-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521. Noevidence for an associated molecular cloud was found in the CO data.
  In this paper, we continue the study of the category of functors Fquad,associated to F_2-vector spaces equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form,initiated in two previous papers of the author. We define a filtration of thestandard projective objects in Fquad; this refines to give a decomposition intoindecomposable factors of the two first standard projective objects in Fquad.As an application of these two decompositions, we give a complete descriptionof the polynomial functors of the category Fquad.
  Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surfaceproperties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to futuremanufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs intoaligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristineSWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for highcurrent, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallelSWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers ofaligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymerfunctionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs inan organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB filmcompression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment andpacking of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration bymicrofabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowestregions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.
  Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding(finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so thatit remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallestspan of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocallyrelated pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and theother is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple ofhalf-integers.
  We investigated structure and morphology of PTFE layers deposited by vacuumprocess in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, depositiontemperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC)layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstratethe orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFEfilms was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means ofellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have beenobtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the coldfriction technique orienting PTFE layers with unidirectional grooves areobtained. On top of these PTFE films oriented PnC layers were grown. Theobtained order depends both on the PTFE layer thickness and on PnC growthtemperature.
  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar TypeIc supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in whichthe GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massivestar to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxiessuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to thecollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary starmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massivehelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization duringcore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a fewmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequentevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequencecompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium starsin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite thestrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retainsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.
  We present a Lohner type algorithm for the computation of rigorous bounds forsolutions of ordinary differential equations and its derivatives with respectto initial conditions up to arbitrary order. As an application we prove theexistence of multiple invariant tori around some elliptic periodic orbits forthe pendulum equation with periodic forcing and for Michelson system.
  In this paper, the notion of {\em $p$-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA)} isintroduced. We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (arefinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. Thisequation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc isthe sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the realHaar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable functiongenerating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for realrefinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same HaarMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differentialoperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can beintensively used for applications.
  The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes fromastrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only thenature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamentalproperties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since asufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source isneeded to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. Inthis work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition andenergy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment onthe theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of theirstructure.
  Recent studies of clustering in light nuclei with an initial energy above 1 AGeV in nuclear treack emulsion are overviewed. The results of investigations ofthe relativistic $^9$Be nuclei fragmentation in emulsion, which entails theproduction of He fragments, are presented. It is shown that most preciseangular measurements provided by this technique play a crucial role in therestoration of the excitation spectrum of the $\alpha$ particle sysytem. Inperipheral interactions $^9$Be nuclei are dissociated practically totallythrough the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states of the $^8$Be nucleus.  The results of investigations of the dissociation of a $^{14}$N nucleus ofmomentum 2.86 A GeV/c in emulsion are presented as example of more complicatedsystem. The momentum and correlation characteristics of $\alpha$ particles forthe $^{14}$N$\to3\alpha+X$ channel in the laboratory system and the restsystems of 3$\alpha$ particles were considered in detail.  Topology of charged fragments produced in peripheral relativisticdissociation of radioactive $^8$B, $^7$Be nuclei in emulsion is studied.
  This is a supplement to the paper arXiv:q-bio/0701050, containing the text ofcorrespondence sent to Nature in 1990.
  In this lecture series, I present the recent progress in our understanding ofnuclear forces in terms of chiral effective field theory.
  We study a loop of Josephson junctions that is quenched through its criticaltemperature. For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can beachieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxationtime is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached fromabove. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but thedependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does nothave to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of theinduced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.
  Using confocal-microscopy we investigate the structure of binary mixtures ofcolloidal hard spheres with size ratio q=0.61. As a function of the packingfraction of the two particle species, we observe a marked change of thedominant wavelength in the pair correlation function. This behavior is inexcellent agreement with a recently predicted structural crossover in suchmixtures. In addition, the repercussions of structural crossover on thereal-space structure of a binary fluid are analyzed. We suggest a relationbetween crossover and the lateral extension of networks containing only equallysized particles that are connected by nearest neighbor bonds. This is supportedby Monte-Carlo simulations which are performed at different packing fractionsand size ratios.
  We discuss phenomenon of simultaneous presence of O- and C-based material insurroundings of evolutionary advanced stars. We concentrate on silicate carbonstars and present observations that directly confirm the binary model scenariofor them. We discuss also class of C-stars with OH emission detected, to whichsome [WR] planetary nebulae do belong.
  We have measured resonance strengths and energies for dielectronicrecombination (DR) of Mg-like Fe XV forming Al-like Fe XIV via N=3 -> N' = 3core excitations in the electron-ion collision energy range 0-45 eV. Allmeasurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the MaxPlanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have alsocarried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using theAUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find pooragreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies andstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two forresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonancestrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger thanour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape betweenthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partlyto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states inthe experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by ourAUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR ratecoefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient isestimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) fork_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predictedto form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found betweenour experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously publishedtheoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smallerthan our experimental results over this temperature range.
  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET andmodels predict emission at > 100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field (2 sr) high dutycycle (> 90 %) ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive airshowers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very highenergy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected since thebeginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. Noevidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we presentupper limits from these bursts.
  In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of agraph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discretespin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometricproof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model onG. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compactoriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting andgluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partitionfunction. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantumfield theory on surface graphs.
  Recent reports on the intriguing features of vector vortex bearing beams areanalyzed using geometric phases in optics. It is argued that the spinredirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topologicalphase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. Aunified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition.Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence withthe angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistentwith our conjecture.
  The layered structure and the rheological properties of anti-wear films,generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zincdialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC)additives, have been studied by dynamic nanoindentation experiments coupledwith a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-frictionexperiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine theevolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure forthe different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressurein the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent frictioncoefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC togetherwith ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPathrough some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <$\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planessliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when thepressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.
  We present in this article a detailed quantitative discussion of themeasurement of the leptonic mixing angle theta_13 through currently scheduledreactor neutrino oscillation experiments. We thus focus on Double Chooz (PhaseI & II), Daya Bay (Phase I & II) and RENO experiments. We perform a unifiedanalysis, including systematics, backgrounds and accurate experimental setup ineach case. Each identified systematic error and background impact has beenassessed on experimental setups following published data when available andextrapolating from Double Chooz acquired knowledge otherwise. After reviewingthe experiments, we present a new analysis of their sensitivities to sin^2(2theta_13) and study the impact of the different systematics based on the pullsapproach. Through this generic statistical analysis we discuss the advantagesand drawbacks of each experimental setup.
  We consider the effect of hard core repulsion in the baryon-baryoninteraction at short distance to the properties of a neutron star. We obtainthat, even with hyperons in the interior of a neutron star, the neutron starmass can be as large as $\sim 2 M_\odot$.
  In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whoseinfrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). Weshow that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compactbranes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closelyrelated to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of theone-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by directcomputation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approachallows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends theresults for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows togeneralize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitraryvalues of the superpotential couplings.
  This paper is concerned with a shape sensitivity analysis of a viscousincompressible fluid driven by Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous boundarycondition. The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of thevariable domain for a given cost function is established by using thedifferentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functionalcombining with function space parametrization technique or function spaceembedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem.Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and theproposed algorithm is feasible.
  The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) in digraphs D with degree bound two issolved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between anincidence matrix C_{nm} of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balancedbipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching ofG to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, andfinding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltoniandigraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces P=NP baseon the results.
  Transport in metals with strongly anisotropic single-particle spectrum isstudied. Coherent band transport in all directions, described by the standardBoltzmann equation, is shown to withstand both elastic and inelastic scatteringas long as $E_F\tau\gg 1$. A model of phonon-assisted tunneling via resonantstates located in between the layers is suggested to explain a non-monotonictemperature dependence of the c-axis resistivity observed in experiments.
  We present a renormalization group motivation of scale hierarchies in SUSYSU(5) model. The Split Higgsino scanrio with a high scale of the SUSY breakingis considered in detail. Its manifestations in experiments are discussed.
  We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk galaxies whoseproperties are intermediate between classical low surface brightness galaxiesand ordinary high surface brightness galaxies. We use data taken from theLowell 1.8m Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall morphology,color, and star formation properties. Morphologically, the galaxies range fromSb through Irr and include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colorsof the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least a slightbluing of the colors with increasing radius. The Halpha images of thesegalaxies show an average star formation rate lower than is found for similarsamples with higher surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxiesstudied have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha emissionthan is found in higher surface brightness samples.
  We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified NewtonianDynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying thevertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circularvelocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the samedisks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and weconstruct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeansequations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. Wefound that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be muchlarger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the morerealistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantlyreduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND andNewtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.
  Some aspects, both experimental and theoretical, of extracting the neutronskin $\Delta R$ from properties of isovector giant resonances are discussed.Existing proposals are critically reviewed. The method relying on the energydifference between the GTR and IAS is shown to lack sensitivity to $\Delta R$.A simple explanation of the linear relation between the symmetry energy and theneutron skin is also given.
  Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection arepresented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops adistinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of theelectron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass,approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise,however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remainsdecoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream fromthe x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems,independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
  A new single-particle shell model is derived by solving the Schr\"odingerequation for a semi-spheroidal potential well. Only the negative parity statesof the $Z(z)$ component of the wave function are allowed, so that new magicnumbers are obtained for oblate semi-spheroids, semi-sphere and prolatesemi-spheroids. The semi-spherical magic numbers are identical with thoseobtained at the oblate spheroidal superdeformed shape: 2, 6, 14, 26, 44, 68,100, 140, ... The superdeformed prolate magic numbers of the semi-spheroidalshape are identical with those obtained at the spherical shape of thespheroidal harmonic oscillator: 2, 8, 20, 40, 70, 112, 168 ...
  To explain the cosmic speed up, brought to light by the recent SNIa and CMBobservations, we propose the following: a) In a spacetime endowed with a FRWmetric, we choose an empirical scale factor that best explains theobservations. b) We assume a modified gravity, generated by an unspecifiedfield lagrangian, $f(R)$. c) We use the adopted empirical scale factor to workback retroactively to obtain $f(R)$, hence the term `Inverse $f(R)$'. d) Nextwe consider the classic GR and a conventional FRW universe that, in addition toits known baryonic content, possesses a hypothetical `Dark Energy' component.We compare the two scenarios, and find the density, the pressure, and theequation of the state of the Dark Energy required to make up for thedifferences between the conventional and the modified GR models.
  We apply well established finite temperature Quantum Monte Carlo techniquesto one dimensional Bose systems with soft and hardcore constraint, as well asto spinless fermion systems. We give clear and robust numerical evidence that,as expected, no superfluid density for Bosons or Meissner fraction forfermions. is possible at {\em any} non zero temperature in one dimensionalinteracting Bose or fermi lattice models, whereas a finite Drude weight isgenerally observed in gapless systems, in partial disagreement to previousexpectations.
  We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations ofthe Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arraysboth in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dustproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistentdisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolvedboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellarmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The diskinclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a positionangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust andCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 isstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion ofdust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration oflarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in thedust distribution by a low mass companion.
  We consider a sequence of additive functionals {\phi_n}, set on a sequence ofMarkov chains {X_n} that weakly converges to a Markov process X. We givesufficient condition for such a sequence to converge in distribution,formulated in terms of the characteristics of the additive functionals, andrelated to the Dynkin's theorem on the convergence of W-functionals. As anapplication of the main theorem, the general sufficient condition forconvergence of additive functionals in terms of transition probabilities of thechains X_n is proved.
  Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient ofmodular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extendthe result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weighton $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations amongFourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applicationswe obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient ofEisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain pointare also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients ofSiegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.
  Drell-Yan dilepton pair production and inclusive direct photon production canbe described within a unified framework in the color dipole approach. Theinclusion of non-perturbative primordial transverse momenta and DGLAP evolutionis studied. We successfully describe data for dilepton spectra from 800-GeV ppcollisions, inclusive direct photon spectra for pp collisions at RHIC energies$\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, and for $p\bar{p}$ collisions at Tevatron energies$\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV, in a formalism that is free from any extra parameters.
  We propose a measurement protocol to generate path-entangled NOON statesconditionally from two pulsed type II optical parametric oscillators. Wecalculate the fidelity of the produced states and the success probability ofthe protocol. The trigger detectors are assumed to have finite dead time, andfor short pulse trigger fields they are modeled as on/off detectors with finiteefficiency. Continuous-wave operation of the parametric oscillators is alsoconsidered.
  This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information,especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditionalstudies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life andcognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at thephysical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistentlyas information becoming more complex.  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiplescales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further usedto discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
  A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of darkenergy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fieldsof dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. Thedark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplyginequations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density ofthe neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativisticneutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at highred-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of thedeceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.
  We performed the first scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on thepyrochlore superconductor KOs2O6 (Tc = 9.6 K) in both zero magnetic field andthe vortex state at several temperatures above 1.95 K. This material presentsatomically flat surfaces, yielding spatially homogeneous spectra which revealfully-gapped superconductivity with a gap anisotropy of 30%. Measurementsperformed at fields of 2 and 6 T display a hexagonal Abrikosov flux linelattice. From the shape of the vortex cores, we extract a coherence length of31-40 {\AA}, in agreement with the value derived from the upper critical fieldHc2. We observe a reduction in size of the vortex cores (and hence thecoherence length) with increasing field which is consistent with theunexpectedly high and unsaturated upper critical field reported.
  In this note we contrast two transformation-based methods to deduce absoluteextrema and the corresponding extremizers. Unlike variation-based methods, thetransformation-based ones of Carlson and Leitmann and the recent one of Silvaand Torres are direct in that they permit obtaining solutions by inspection.
  In this paper we study a class of backward stochastic differential equations(BSDEs) of the form dY(t)= -AY(t)dt -f_0(t,Y(t))dt -f_1(t,Y(t),Z(t))dt +Z(t)dW(t) on the interval [0,T], with given final condition at time T, in aninfinite dimensional Hilbert space H. The unbounded operator A is sectorial anddissipative and the nonlinearity f_0(t,y) is dissipative and defined for y onlytaking values in a subspace of H. A typical example is provided by theso-called polynomial nonlinearities. Applications are given to stochasticpartial differential equations and spin systems.
  This paper presents an experimental study and the lessons learned from theobservation of the attackers when logged on a compromised machine. The resultsare based on a six months period during which a controlled experiment has beenrun with a high interaction honeypot. We correlate our findings with thoseobtained with a worldwide distributed system of lowinteraction honeypots.
  For dynamical dark energy cosmologies we carry out a series of N-bodygravitational simulations, achieving percent level accuracy in the relativemass power spectra at any redshift. Such accuracy in the power spectrum isnecessary for next generation cosmological mass probes. Our matching procedurereproduces the CMB distance to last scattering and delivers subpercent levelpower spectra at z=0 and z~3. We discuss the physical implications for probingdark energy with surveys of large scale structure.
  We observe the proliferation of vortices in theBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a two-dimensional array ofJosephson-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. As long as the Josephson(tunneling) energy J exceeds the thermal energy T, the array is vortex-free.With decreasing J/T, vortices appear in the system in ever greater numbers. Weconfirm thermal activation as the vortex formation mechanism and obtaininformation on the size of bound vortex pairs as J/T is varied.
  Some multipartite quantum states can be generated in a sequential mannerwhich may be implemented by various physical setups like microwave and opticalcavity QED, trapped ions, and quantum dots etc. We analyze the general N to Mqubits Universal Quantum Cloning Machine (UQCM) within a sequential generationscheme. We show that the N to M sequential UQCM is available. The case ofd-level quantum states sequential cloning is also presented.
  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subjectto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints sincesensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor indetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning theprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) tomaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the linkcommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overallcommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a numberof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) andalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for bothmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graphdescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, weformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to acommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem towhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensivenumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergencespeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance ofa non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.
  We calculate the N_c dependence of the decay widths of exotic eikosiheptapletwithin the framework of Chral Quark Soliton Model. We also discussgeneralizations of regular baryon representations for arbitrary N_c.
  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimatethe density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 activegalactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on boardSpitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low densitylimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths andignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs havelower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with lineflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue thatdifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust inthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limitand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of thetorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount ofextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the lineratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densitiesassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. Wealso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extendedand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission fromlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios fromsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearbygalaxies.
  We observe that the radial gauge can be consistently imposed \emph{together}with the Lorenz gauge in Maxwell theory, and with the harmonic traceless gaugein linearized general relativity. This simple observation has relevance forsome recent developments in quantum gravity where the radial gauge isimplicitly utilized.
  Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different andlong term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for theassessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokineticproperties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic DietaryExposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, forthe moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as theSECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose aseries of household quantities into individual quantities which are then usedas inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to thepresence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.
  In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane movingthrough a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes thecreation of photons out of vacuum fluctuations, a moving brane leads tograviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK)particles scale like stiff matter with the expansion of the Universe and cantherefore not represent the dark matter in a warped braneworld. We presentresults for the production of massless and KK gravitons for bouncing branes infive-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that for a realistic bounce theback reaction from the generated gravitons will be most likely relevant. Thisletter summarizes the main results and conclusions from numerical simulationswhich are presented in detail in a long paper [M.Ruser and R. Durrer, Phys.Rev. D 76, 104014 (2007), arXiv:0704.0790]
  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graphdefined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations playan important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employedin the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrarydimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some knownresults are given.  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion andcontraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubesfrom old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finitepartial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.
  We investigate the bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO using densityfunctional calculations. We find that H is anionic and does not formmulticenter bonds with Zn in this compound.
  We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining`quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core toexplore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernovaexplosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotrondiagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intensemagnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in spaceapproaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta massdriven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHDshock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star ascompared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both thegravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
  We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films onNb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire,followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages ofAl2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-raydiffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nblattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with furtherdeposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth.Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer,the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.
  We show that there is a unique Markov trace on the tower of Temperley--Liebtype quotients of Hecke algebras of Coxeter type $E_n$ (for all $n \geq 6$). Weexplain in detail how this trace may be computed easily using tom Dieck'scalculus of diagrams. As applications, we show how to use the trace to showthat the diagram representation is faithful, and to compute leadingcoefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.
  The structural environment of substitutional Cr3+ ion in MgAl2O4 spinel hasbeen investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies.First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANESspectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-Odistance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the firstneighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. Theseobservations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry ofthe B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Crfor Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bondbuckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centredoctahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the anglesbetween the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the threefour-fold axes of the cubic structure.
  The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has beenstudied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, atresidence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading toconversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified andquantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen,ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermaldecomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed.Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecularinitiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generateddiradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals,reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.
  The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations ofmotion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of `generalized' Maxwell'sequations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initialvalue constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paperwill be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under timeevolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but ratherthe Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparisonwith the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.
  We study the relationship between transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constantand Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneeredby Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potentialtheoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equalfor all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement istrue: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with itstransfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. Anabundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.
  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has beenexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlinwave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and thePfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a generalscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformalfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonicvertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electronoperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identicalto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave functionhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almostidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactlyrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFTcorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFTrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rmth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- andquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge andstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs thatdescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's generalclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest ageneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for otherfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at fillingfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.
  We have investigated the doping dependence of the penetration depth vs.temperature in electron doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ using a modelwhich assumes the uniform coexistence of (mean-field) antiferromagnetism andsuperconductivity. Despite the presence of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing gap in theunderlying spectrum, we find nodeless behavior of the low-$T$ penetration depthin underdoped case, in accord with experimental results. As doping increases, alinear-in-$T$ behavior of the penetration depth, characteristic of d-wavepairing, emerges as the lower magnetic band crosses the Fermi level and createsa nodal Fermi surface pocket.
  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic ofplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detectionadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, andreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populatedthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarfwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawnfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence thatthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetarysystem.
  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (includinginteracting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclideanquantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that theisometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have eitherself-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue theself-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct aunitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzianmanifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whoseLorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.
  This paper studies normalized Ricci flow on a nonparabolic surface, whosescalar curvature is asymptotically -1 in an integral sense. By a methodinitiated by R. Hamilton, the flow is shown to converge to a metric of constantscalar curvature -1. A relative estimate of Green's function is proved as atool.
  The ordering of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangularlattice with the the bilinear-biquadratic interaction is studied by Monte Carlosimulations. It is shown that the model exhibits a topological phase transitionat a finite-temperature driven by topologically stable vortices, while the spincorrelation length remains finite even at and below the transition point. Therelevant vortices could be of three different types, depending on the value ofthe biquadratic coupling. Implications to recent experiments on the triangularantiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$ is discussed.
  We study weak localization in chains of metallic rings. We show thannonlocality of quantum transport can drastically affect the behaviour of theharmonics of magnetoconductance oscillations. Two different geometries areconsidered: the case of rings separated by long wires compared to the phasecoherence length and the case of contacted rings. In a second part we discussthe role of decoherence due to electron-electron interaction in these twogeometries.
  The recently updated data of the twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations(kHz QPOs) in the neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries are analyzed. Thepower-law fitting $\nu_{1}=a(\nu_{2}/1000)^{b}$ and linear fitting$\nu_{2}=A\nu_{1}+B$ are applied, individually, to the data points of four Zsources (GX 17+2, GX 340+0, GX 5-1 and Sco X-1) and four Atoll sources (4U0614+09, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1728-34). The $\chi^{2}$-tests show thatthe power-law correlation and linear correlation both can fit data well.Moreover, the comparisons between the data and the theoretical models for kHzQPOs are discussed.
  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates animportant and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization ofexo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achievebetter than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecondwith careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio InterferometricPLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescopethat will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planetmass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increaseastrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossalcollecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracyto 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth massplanets possible.  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a uniquevolume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameterspace of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at largeradii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, thetargets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, activestars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivitywill extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometricmethods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methodsdemonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmapfor exoplanet discovery and characterization.
  The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, densityand composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the propertiesof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiativetransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiationfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-raybackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC andthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporatingbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausiblerange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input toradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Datafrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in theheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used toconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI columndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all theobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electrondensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, withsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; howeverC is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, andpartially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, andX(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models arefound for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor lowvalues for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.
  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projectionpursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the highdimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weaklydependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model whichis robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index isidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function ofthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is agenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed forthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistentand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which issufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension withinseconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborateswith the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the riveflow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.
  I present results from an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory ofelectron-phonon interactions and superconductivity. The history of theelectron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediateparameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cupratesuperconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases areexamined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity.Results of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functionsand phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem,the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.
  We consider the orbit of the bullet cluster 1E 0657-56 in both CDM and MONDusing accurate mass models appropriate to each case in order to ascertain themaximum plausible collision velocity. Impact velocities consistent with theshock velocity (~ 4700km/s) occur naturally in MOND. CDM can generate collisionvelocities of at most ~ 3800km/s, and is only consistent with the data providedthat the shock velocity has been substantially enhanced by hydrodynamicaleffects.
  We analyze a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics ofcoexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species arelocalized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rulesare inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels ofmean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent toan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonizedby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximationis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. Thepair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence ofprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time andanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the populationdensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise througha Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditionsand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend oninitial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically morerealistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.
  A new expression as a certain asymptotic limit via "discrete micro-states" ofpermutations is provided to the mutual information of both continuous anddiscrete random variables.
  The critical adsorption point (CAP) of self-avoiding walks (SAW) interactingwith a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has beenstudied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developedby Soteros and Whittington (J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325), thatdescribe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlosimulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also showsimulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations usedin the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understandingthe correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymeradsorption.
  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signaltransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identicalthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms ofstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random inputsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even smallamounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSRin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship betweenShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition foroptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity isachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from thenoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signaldistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoreticalverification and justification for previous work in both computationalneuroscience and electronics.
  In a ring of s-wave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantizedin units of $\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}$. It is well known from the theory ofJosephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wavematerial, then the flux is quantized in one-half of those units due to aadditional phase shift of $\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms ofgeometric phase.  We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave andpure d-wave electron pairs. We find, for this idealized configuration, that thephase shift of $\pi$ follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase andis thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics.
  We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint differentialoperators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties,which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing undersmall perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class ofelliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operatorsdefined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols.We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on theWeyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra.When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectralinstabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions whichcan be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical descriptionof them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in somenumerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far fromtheir spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.
  We give a microscopic derivation of the Clausius-Mossotti relations for ahomogeneous and isotropic magneto-dielectric medium consisting of radiativelybroadened atomic oscillators. To this end the diagram series of electromagneticpropagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice ofdielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to theresonance wavelength $\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies andlinewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in aselfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interactionterms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to thefree-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches thevalue -2 in the limit of $\rho \lambda^3 \gg 1$, where $\rho$ is the numberdensity of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as$1/\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizinglow-loss negative index materials.
  The fourth science run of the LIGO and GEO 600 gravitational-wave detectors,carried out in early 2005, collected data with significantly lower noise thanprevious science runs. We report on a search for short-durationgravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64-1600 Hz frequencyrange appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests,data quality cuts, and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rateof spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 daysof live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 per day (at90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to bedetected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized usingMonte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previoussearches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at whichrepresentative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detectedwith 50% efficiency by this analysis.
  The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings withtwo electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, theevolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can beexactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state wasfound to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as anoscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. Anumber of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters havebeen found.
  Three-body decays of resonant states are studied using integral formulae fordecay widths. Theoretical approach with a simplified Hamiltonian allowssemianalytical treatment of the problem. The model is applied to decays of thefirst excited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and the $3/2^{-}$ ground state of$^{45}$Fe. The convergence of three-body hyperspherical model calculations tothe exact result for widths and energy distributions are studied. Thetheoretical results for $^{17}$Ne and $^{45}$Fe decays are updated anduncertainties of the derived values are discussed in detail. Correlations forthe decay of $^{17}$Ne $3/2^-$ state are also studied.
  The sequence of phase transitions and the symmetry of in particular the lowtemperature incommensurate and spin-Peierls phases of the quasi one-dimensionalinorganic spin-Peierls system TiOX (TiOBr and TiOCl) have been studied usinginelastic light scattering experiments. The anomalous first-order character ofthe transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of thedifferent symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$)phases.  The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature stronglysuggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in theformation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, acomparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energyscattering observed previously has a phononic origin.
  We show that the electromagnetic moments of unstable particles (resonances)have an absorptive contribution which quantifies the change of the particle'slifetime in an external electromagnetic field. To give an example we computehere the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon andthe neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider ananalogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The resultfor the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magneticfield of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of$3\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. Wespeculate on the observable implications of this effect.
  We analyze 27 house price indexes of Las Vegas from Jun. 1983 to Mar. 2005,corresponding to 27 different zip codes. These analyses confirm the existenceof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster thanexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited timeinterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and hasprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable topre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for amedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearlyperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction frommonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed couldconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returnedto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolutionof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significantvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seemsto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately twoyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole ofthe USA).
  We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime powerFrobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles offinite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admitsan analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C haveintegral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As aconsequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime powerdimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction oftwisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (thisis reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras interms of Manin pairs).
  We prove a duality theorem for certain graded algebras and show by variousexamples different kinds of failure of tameness of local cohomology.
  We study material lines and passive vectors in a model of turbulent flow atinfinite-Reynolds number, the Kraichnan-Kazantsev ensemble of velocities thatare white-noise in time and rough (Hoelder continuous) in space. It is arguedthat the phenomenon of ``spontaneous stochasticity'' generalizes to materiallines and that conservation of circulations generalizes to a ``martingaleproperty'' of the stochastic process of lines.
  Let $ v$ be a smooth vector field on the plane, that is a map from the planeto the unit circle. We study sufficient conditions for the boundedness of theHilbert transform  \operatorname H_{v, \epsilon}f(x) := \text{p.v.}\int_{-\epsilon}^ \epsilonf(x-yv(x)) \frac{dy}y where $ \epsilon $ is a suitably chosen parameter,determined by the smoothness properties of the vector field. It is aconjecture, due to E.\thinspace M.\thinspace Stein, that if $ v$ is Lipschitz,there is a positive $ \epsilon $ for which the transform above is bounded on $L ^{2}$. Our principal result gives a sufficient condition in terms of theboundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient conditionis that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $1<p<2$. We show that the maximal function is bounded from $ L ^{2}$ to weak $ L^{2}$ for all Lipschitz maximal function. The relationship between our resultsand other known sufficient conditions is explored.
  A parametric study of so-called "super growth" of single-walled carbonnanotubes(SWNTs) was done by using combinatorial libraries of iron/aluminumoxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, andthose grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer (about 0.5 nm) were SWNTs.Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions suchas gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fecatalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide.Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, playsan essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates.
  The star HE 1305-0007 is a metal-poor double-enhanced star with metallicity[Fe/H] $=-2.0$, which is just at the upper limit of the metallicity for theobserved double-enhanced stars. Using a parametric model, we find that almostall s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be amember of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material hasexperienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and isdredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset ofcommon-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007,we speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, inwhich the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.
  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: apure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methaneand 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the puremethane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding toa ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames havebeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentrationprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after samplingwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide anddioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using aPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in ourlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The mainreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.
  The Green function (GF) equation of motion technique for solving theeffective two-band Hubbard model of high-T_c superconductivity in cuprates[N.M. Plakida et al., Phys. Rev. B, v. 51, 16599 (1995); JETP, v. 97, 331(2003)] rests on the Hubbard operator (HO) algebra. We show that, if we takeinto account the invariance to translations and spin reversal, the HO algebraresults in invariance properties of several specific correlation functions. Theuse of these properties allows rigorous derivation and simplification of theexpressions of the frequency matrix (FM) and of the generalized mean fieldapproximation (GMFA) Green functions (GFs) of the model.  For the normal singlet hopping and anomalous exchange pairing correlationfunctions which enter the FM and GMFA-GFs, an approximation procedure based onthe identification and elimination of exponentially small quantities isdescribed. It secures the reduction of the correlation order to GMFA-GFexpressions.
  The usual procedure of including a finite number of vertices in NonPerturbative Renormalization Group equations in order to obtain $n$-pointcorrelation functions at finite momenta is analyzed. This is done by exploitinga general method recently introduced which includes simultaneously all verticesalthough approximating their momentum dependence. The study is performed usingthe self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least inthis example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent$\eta$ by as much as 60%. However, if one goes to high order truncations theprocedure seems to converge rapidly.
  The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in thetrigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenionelectromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In thetrigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic,gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusionsof field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles whichare consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In thetrigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong andstrong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the fieldsource particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research resultsshow that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
  Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction athigh enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show thatcatalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and thatcomplex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysisbased on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patternsresult from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the consideredsystem.
  Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible tounderstand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature.The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg andhis colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on canceraccumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that consideringall available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancertheory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancertheories. They have then listed 9 "absolute discrepancies" for such cancertheory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their majorreasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and afirst principle computation, is explicitly pointed out.
  We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomicmolecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-fieldapproximation. The interference structure resulting from the individualcontributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail,with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecularorientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes inwhich the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscurethe interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes.However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has aclassical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clearinterference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able toinfer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacentinterference minima.
  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devotedto the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remainunchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of adiscrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inversekinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to thisproblem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet importantrequirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so thatit yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (butsuitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to theboundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theoremcan be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initialdistribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptoticapproximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimatesof customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificialcompressibility method are discussed.
  Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape incentral Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Aucollisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: largeangle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependentenergy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conicalflow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particlecorrelations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, thedependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles canbe used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and fromQCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthalcorrelations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtractionof combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtractionand the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implicationsof the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones arediscussed.
  Single-molecule detection with chemical specificity is a powerful and muchdesired tool for biology, chemistry, physics, and sensing technologies.Surface-enhanced spectroscopies enable single molecule studies, yet reliablesubstrates of adequate sensitivity are in short supply. We present a simple,scaleable substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)incorporating nanometer-scale electromigrated gaps between extended electrodes.Molecules in the nanogap active regions exhibit hallmarks of very high Ramansensitivity, including blinking and spectral diffusion. Electrodynamicsimulations show plasmonic focusing, giving electromagnetic enhancementsapproaching those needed for single-molecule SERS.
  We show how one can obtain a lower bound for the electrical, spin or heatconductivity of correlated quantum systems described by Hamiltonians of theform H = H0 + g H1. Here H0 is an interacting Hamiltonian characterized byconservation laws which lead to an infinite conductivity for g=0. The smallperturbation g H1, however, renders the conductivity finite at finitetemperatures. For example, H0 could be a continuum field theory, where momentumis conserved, or an integrable one-dimensional model while H1 might describethe effects of weak disorder. In the limit g to 0, we derive lower bounds forthe relevant conductivities and show how they can be improved systematicallyusing the memory matrix formalism. Furthermore, we discuss various applicationsand investigate under what conditions our lower bound may become exact.
  A quantum critical point (QCP) between the antiferromagnetic and theparamagnetic phases was realized by applying a hydrostatic pressure of ~ 7 GPaon single crystals of NiS_{2} pyrite with a low residual resistivity, rho_{0},of 0.5 mu-Omega-cm. We found that the critical behavior of the resistivity,rho, in this clean system contrasts sharply with those observed in itsdisordered analogue, NiS_{2-x}Se_{x} solid-solution, demonstrating theunexpectedly drastic effect of disorder on the quantum criticality. Over awhole paramagnetic region investigated up to P = 9 GPa, a crossovertemperature, defined as the onset of T^{2} dependence of rho, an indication ofFermi liquid, was suppressed to a substantially low temperature T sim 2 K and,instead, a non Fermi liquid behavior of rho, T^{3/2}-dependence, robustlyshowed up.
  We prove a variation of Gronwall's lemma.
  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretchelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. Thesedistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramaticeffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transportalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture theelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, webegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronicstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurationsencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results arecomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the statesof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronicstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that candescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as thepresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of thesubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian whichleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by severalorders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretchedstructure.
  We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for thevelocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use aprojection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. We show thatthe differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discretecounterparts share similar properties. In particular we state an inf-sup(Babuska-Brezzi) condition. Using these properties we infer the stability ofthe scheme.
  Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films have been shown to demonstrate varioustribological behaviors: in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), with either frictioncoefficients as low as 0.01 or less and very mild wear, or very high frictioncoefficients (>0.4) and drastic wear. These behaviors depend notably on gaseousenvironment, hydrogen content of the film [1], and on its viscoplasticproperties [2,3]. A relation between superlow friction in UHV andviscoplasticity has indeed been established for a-C:H films and confirmed for afluorinated sample (a-C:F:H). In this study, nanoindentation and nanoscratchtests were conducted in ambient air, using a nanoindentation apparatus, inorder to evaluate tribological behaviors, as well as mechanical andviscoplastic properties of different amorphous carbon films.
  We consider a single ion confined in a trap under radiation of two travelingwaves of lasers. In the strong-excitation regime and without the restriction ofLamb-Dicke limit, the Hamiltonian of the system is similar to a drivingJaynes-Cummings model without rotating wave approximation (RWA). The approachwe developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes itavailable to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the groundstate in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart underthe RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spindependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the differencebetween the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevantexperimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantuminformation processing.
  This paper examines the effect of temperature on the structural stability andmechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics(TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain itsstructural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 incompression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasingtemperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit,Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10,0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature rangefrom 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasingwith increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At highertemperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio andtensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, theSWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed andsoftened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of300K to 900K.
  We improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required formeasurement-based quantum computation. Minimizing the resources required forthis model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computerbased on projective measurements. This new upper bound allows also to reply inthe negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off betweenobservable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.
  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengthsof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forminggalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find thatthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the densefilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorptionnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. Wealso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close togalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around thegalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metalabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models withoutfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIVand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the meantransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forminggalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI isindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOSwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback canproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We concludethat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.
  We have analysed four ASCA observations (1994--1995, 1996--1997) and threeXMM-Newton observations (2005) of this source, in all of which the source is inhigh/soft state. We modeled the continuum spectra with relativistic disk modelkerrbb, estimated the spin of the central black hole, and constrained thespectral hardening factor f_col and the distance. If kerrbb model applies, fornormally used value of f_col, the distance cannot be very small, and f_colchanges with observations.
  We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a$3<p_T<4$ GeV/c trigger particle with two softer $1<p_T<2$ GeV/c particles.Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Aucollisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition,the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of theassociated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simpleQCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is thesubtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to thissubtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail.
  We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be anonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet stateof massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, withoutmaking any appeal to detector inefficiencies.  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massivetwo-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles arenot ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) canpropagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to theother detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a localinterpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in aStern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detectorloophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is onlysignificant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the localityloophole.
  We study the high temperature phase of a family of typed branching diffusionsinitially studied in [Ast\'{e}risque 236 (1996) 133--154] and [Lecture Notes inMath. 1729 (2000) 239--256 Springer, Berlin]. The primary aim is to establishsome almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particlesystem, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes bothspace and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population growswithin this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of anexplicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficientnumbers with spatial positions near $-\gamma t$ and type positions near $\kappa\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a varietyof martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving achange of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model'sintrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adaptto other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to travelingwave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.
  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) havesuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slopenear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic blackhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio fluxemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard stateinterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) issimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that atwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really doeshave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGNand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present animproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based onconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits ofcontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, wellfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit byadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is notunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a secondbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rateimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency foundin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with otherAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.
  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results incomplex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequentchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, theassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics islimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development andself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithmbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigatethe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, touncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is onnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls betweenmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they arecapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability tochange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of smallgroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being thattheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of thetime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimatingthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamentaldifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.
  The noteworthy BaBar and Belle evidence for $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixingmotivates us to study its impact on $D^0\to K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ decays and theirCP-conjugate processes. We show that both the $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixingparameters ($x$ and $y$) and the strong phase difference between $\bar{D}^0\toK^{*\pm}K^\mp$ and $D^0\to K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ transitions ($\delta$) can bedetermined or constrained from the time-dependent measurements of these decaymodes. On the $\psi (3770)$ and $\psi (4140)$ resonances at a $\tau$-charmfactory, it is even possible to determine or constrain $x$, $y$ and $\delta$from the time-independent measurements of coherent $(D^0\bar{D}^0) \to(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)$ decays. If the CP-violating phase of$D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing is significant in a scenario beyond the standardmodel, it can also be extracted from the $K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ events.
  This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtainpragmatic space-time trellis codes over block-fading channel. We show that goodperformance can be achieved even when puncturation is adopted and that we canstill employ the same Viterbi decoder of the convolutional mother code by usingapproximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decodingoperations.
  The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to theequations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors.The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves ofgalaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require themodification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a fivedimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle ofconservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value ofar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely onkey cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitationalconstant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law ofgravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary betweena four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking thespeed of light to the mass of the Universe.
  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetizedstripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolvedBrillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found thatthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near thelateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamicmagnetization takes place at the edges.  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along awaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interactionwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. Theexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that theshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by theconfinement.
  At first we introduce an action for the string, which leads to a worldsheetthat always is curved. For this action we study the Poincar\'e symmetry and theassociated conserved currents. Then, a generalization of the above action,which contains an arbitrary function of the two-dimensional scalar curvature,will be introduced. An extra scalar field enables us to modify these actions toWeyl invariant models.
  We investigate the topological phase associated with the double connectednessof the SO(3) representation in terms of maximally entangled states. Anexperimental demonstration is provided in the context of polarization andspatial mode transformations of a laser beam carrying orbital angular momentum.The topological phase is evidenced through interferometric measurements and aquantitative relationship between the concurrence and the fringes visibility isderived. Both the quantum and the classical regimes were investigated.
  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem ofclustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We considerlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can beneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with anadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. Weemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationaryanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. Thesesolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up ina finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowupssignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-uptime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ whilethe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shockdiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at thesingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gaspressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in timeclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the densityblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an "ordinary" shock, at which thehydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of theexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solvingthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutionsshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.
  In this paper, we propose a direct solution method for optimal switchingproblems of one-dimensional diffusions. This method is free from conjecturesabout the form of the value function and switching strategies, or does notrequire the proof of optimality through quasi-variational inequalities. Thedirect method uses a general theory of optimal stopping problems forone-dimensional diffusions and characterizes the value function as sets of thesmallest linear majorants in their respective transformed spaces.
  As main result we show that for each g > 1 there is some translation surfaceof genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL(2,Z). We useorigamis/square-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article is dividedinto two parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, origamis,Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two origamis in genus 2 thattheir Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide atechnique that produces sequences of origamis whose Veech groups aredecreasing. This is used to prove the main result.
  In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$, with$0<p\le 1$, $0<q\le \infty$. We discuss the atomic decomposition of theelements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior ofsingular integrals and other operators acting on them.
  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brainwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into manyproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, totheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complexnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural andfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networksrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties thathave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new networkanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat andmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmarkrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysisstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes andconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brainnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-freenetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneckconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brainsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'connectivity.
  We measured the correlation of the times between successive flaps of a flagfor a variety of wind speeds and found no evidence of low dimensional chaoticbehavior in the return maps of these times. We instead observed what is bestmodeled as random times determined by an exponential distribution. This studywas done as an undergraduate experiment and illustrates the differences betweenlow dimensional chaotic and possibly higher dimensional chaotic systems.
  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model ofone-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particlesthat are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particlescollide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose massand speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in theasymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes thenumber of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Ourmain result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based onthe discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which statesthat the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion ofneighbor particles.
  We discuss the phenomenological impact of a particularly interesting cornerof the MSSM: the large tan(beta) regime. The capabilities of leptonic andhadronic Flavor Violating processes in shedding light on physics beyond theStandard Model are reviewed. Moreover, we show that tests of LeptonUniversality in charged current processes can represent an interesting handleto obtain relevant information on New Physics scenarios.
  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hyain quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radialvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the firsttime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed thetheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) andNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains thatextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya ispresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta andhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at theouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow ofmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) andclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with theaccretion curtain model.
  Aims: We aim at estimating the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and thephysical parameters related to the black holes harbored in eight highX-ray-to-optical (F_X/F_R>10) obscured quasars at z>0.9 selected in the 2--10keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical andKs-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs aremodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (usingthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associatedwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of redquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation areused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the blackholes residing in these AGN.  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observednear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in therange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive highstellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretionphase.
  I present here results of a time-dependent analysis of the Dalitz structureof neutral $B$ meson decays to  $\pip\pim\piz$ from a dataset of 346 million $B \bar B$ pairs collected atthe $\Upsilon(4S)$ center of mass energy by the BaBar detector at the SLACPEP-II $e^+e^-$ accelerator. No significant CP violation effects are observedand 68% confidence interval is derived on the weak angle $\alpha$ to be[75$^o$,152$^o$]
  The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-rayemission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons withthe solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuseextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. Whilethis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, thesituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailedstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting forthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, whichinterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moonsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence foremission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with ourmodel for the extended emission.
  I describe the different classes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and thebasic tenets of unified schemes. I then review the properties of theextragalactic sources detected in the GeV and TeV bands, showing that the vastmajority of them belong to the very rare blazar class. I further discuss thekind of AGN GLAST is likely to detect, making some predictions going from theobvious to the likely, all the way to the less probable.
  Let ${\mathcal S}(\R)$ be an o-minimal structure over $\R$, $T \subset\R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}$ a closed definable set, and $$ \displaylines{\pi_1:\R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{k_1 + k_2}, \pi_2: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{\ell}, \\pi_3: \R^{k_1 + k_2} \to \R^{k_2}} $$ the projection maps.  For any collection ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of subsets of$\R^{k_1+k_2}$, and $\z \in \R^{k_2}$, let $\A_\z$ denote the collection ofsubsets of $\R^{k_1}$, $\{A_{1,\z},..., A_{n,\z}\}$, where $A_{i,\z} = A_i \cap\pi_3^{-1}(\z), 1 \leq i \leq n$. We prove that there exists a constant $C =C(T) > 0,$ such that for any family ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ ofdefinable sets, where each $A_i = \pi_1(T \cap \pi_2^{-1}(\y_i))$, for some$\y_i \in \R^{\ell}$, the number of distinct stable homotopy types of $\A_\z,\z \in \R^{k_2}$, is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+1)k_2},} $while the number of distinct homotopy types is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C\cdot n^{(k_1+3)k_2}.} $ This generalizes to the general o-minimal setting,bounds of the same type proved in \cite{BV} for semi-algebraic andsemi-Pfaffian families. One main technical tool used in the proof of the aboveresults, is a topological comparison theorem which might be of independentinterest in the study of arrangements.
  Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, witheach token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcsof the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especiallyrevealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomaticdefinition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of anymedium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finiteset S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on agiven set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.
  Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, thegravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations ina straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it accelerationtensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat spacecosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy.In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between theRiemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case ofa positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version ofthe Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior thecomponents of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign,leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model iscovered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both thetotal energy and the zero point energy vanish.
  We examine e+e- --> Ds- Ds*+ and Ds*- Ds+ interactions at 4170 MeV using theCLEO-c detector in order to measure the decay constant fDs+. We use the Ds+ -->l+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+--> pi+ nu. Analyzing both modes independently, we determine B(Ds+ --> mu+ nu)= (0.594 +- 0.066 +- 0.031)%, and B(Ds+ --> tau+ nu) = (8.0 +- 1.3 +- 0.4)%. Wealso analyze them simultaneously to find an effective value of B{eff}(Ds+ -->mu+ nu) = (0.638 +- 0.059 +- 0.033)% and extract fDs = (274 +- 13 +- 7) MeV.Combining with our previous determination of B(D+ -> mu+ nu), we also find theratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We compare to current theoreticalestimates. Finally, we find B(Ds+ --> e+ nu) < 1.3 x10^{-4} at 90% confidencelevel.
  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysicalplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to themean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotronfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the "inertial range" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the "dissipation range" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physicalapplications are discussed in detail.
  We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSSsources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. Thedip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together withindependent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip inextragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot arephysically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomalynor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate fromstructures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining needfor non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explainthe cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seenstatistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a singleregion. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requiresa ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. Thisis far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and addsto the anomalies seen in the CMB.
  We present optical spectroscopy of nine cataclysmic binary stars, mostlydwarf novae, obtained primarily to determine orbital periods Porb. The starsand their periods are LX And, 0.1509743(5) d; CZ Aql, 0.2005(6) d; LU Cam,0.1499686(4) d; GZ Cnc, 0.0881(4) d; V632 Cyg, 0.06377(8) d; V1006 Cyg,0.09903(9) d; BF Eri, 0.2708804(4) d; BI Ori, 0.1915(5) d; and FO Per, forwhich Porb is either 0.1467(4) or 0.1719(5) d.  Several of the stars proved to be especially interesting. In BF Eri, wedetect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1subclass, which leads to a distance estimate of approximately 1 kpc. However,BF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminaryparallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only anupper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, andit appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines havestrong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting amagnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg placesit squarely within the 2- to 3-hour "gap" in the distribution of cataclysmicbinary orbital periods.
  In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid isstudied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors aresolved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under thesame conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocityprofile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature ofthe fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower asviscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causalviscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due tonon-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not bemimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.
  We investigate the effect of the bulk content in the general Gauss-Bonnetbraneworld on the evolution of the universe. We find that the Gauss-Bonnet termand the combination of the dark radiation and the matter content of the bulkplay a crucial role in the universe evolution. We show that our model candescribe the super-acceleration of our universe with the equation of state ofthe effective dark energy in agreement with observations.
  We study the dependence of the isophotal shape of early-type galaxies ontheir absolute B-band magnitude, their dynamical mass, and their nuclearactivity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-typegalaxies identified in the SDSS by Hao et al (2006). We find that the fractionof disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The largesample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linearrelations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in theisophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlationsbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in theoptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, grouphierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can beaccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxyluminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shapeof early-type galaxies.
  In this article we will first prove a result about convergence in capacity.Using the achieved result we will obtain a general decompositon theorem forcomplex Monge-Ampere measues which will be used to prove a comparison principlefor the complex Monge-Ampere operator.
  Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework fordefining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantumfield theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlationfunctions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braidedquantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopfalgebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required forthe relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to thePoincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One isthe effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupledwith spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other isnoncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum fieldtheory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.
  In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions ofsome types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based ondecomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders.It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s),each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) forone dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expressionof the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE.Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in itshighest derivatives.  The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can reallysolve many of different order PDEs with different number of independentvariables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstratea potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.
  The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is aquite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps.Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation thatcontains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. Inthis work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition ofDuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of thenew obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of ourmain result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when oneconsider maps that are ergodic.
  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and useit obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs andalgorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions ofgraphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and havereceived increased attention in recent years. In particular, our coloredpebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu andgive a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. Wealso present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections betweenpebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow andWestermann and Hendrickson.
  We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution ofthe field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. Inparticular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterizedpost-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPNparameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of generalrelativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that isproportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPNvector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by thenon-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. Bymapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study thecorrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of pointparticles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find thatthe Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used bycurrent and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters ofChern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.
  Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessibleto current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the firststars. Recently, strong direct evidence for significant CIB levels produced bythe first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images.Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra ofhigh-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLASTsources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information onenergetics and constituents of the first stars era.
  In this note we develop tools and techniques for the treatment of anisotropicthermo-elasticity in two space dimensions. We use a diagonalisation techniqueto obtain properties of the characteristic roots of the full symbol of thesystem in order to prove $L^p$--$L^q$ decay rates for its solutions.
  In this paper we investigate some entanglement properties for the Hydrogenmolecule considered as a two interacting spin 1/2 (qubit) model. Theentanglement related to the $H_{2}$ molecule is evaluated both using the vonNeumann entropy and the Concurrence and it is compared with the correspondingquantities for the two interacting spin system. Many aspects of these functionsare examinated employing in part analytical and, essentially, numericaltechniques. We have compared analogous results obtained by Huang and Kais a fewyears ago. In this respect, some possible controversial situations arepresented and discussed.
  We investigate a pair entanglement of electrons in diatomic molecule, modeledas a correlated double quantum dot attached to the leads. The low-temperatureproperties are derived from the ground state obtained by utilizing theRejec-Ramsak variational technique within the framework of EDABI method, whichcombines exact diagonalization with ab initio calculations. The results show,that single-particle basis renormalization modifies the entanglement-switcheffectiveness significantly. We also found the entanglement signature of acompetition between an extended Kondo and singlet phases.
  A nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model is considered. First weintegrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q.Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformationof the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k <Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equationis consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integrationresults for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of thephi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We comparethe expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammaticperturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in whichsense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.
  We report observation of spin-orbit Berry's phase in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB)type oscillation of weak field magnetoresistance in an anti-dot lattice (ADL)of a two-dimensional hole system. An AB-type oscillation is superposed on thecommensurability peak, and the main peak in the Fourier transform is clearlysplit up due to variation in Berry's phase originating from the spin-orbitinteraction. A simulation considering Berry's phase and the phase arising fromthe spin-orbit shift in the momentum space shows qualitative agreement with theexperiment.
  Using a large galaxy group catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky SurveyData Release 4 we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignmentwithin groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest groupgalaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignmentbetween the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards itsBGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of itssatellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxiesare preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with thedirection to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, areperfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r < 0.1 \Rvir, wefind a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellitesand BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak lensing measurements.
  We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert$G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embeddinginto a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and itsaction on $\cla$ is ergodic.
  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-mediumselfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson wedemonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering ofthe mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly anymass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectralfunctions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decaybranching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires aquantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to bepart of any reliable theory.
  In quantum mechanics textbooks the momentum operator is defined in theCartesian coordinates and rarely the form of the momentum operator in sphericalpolar coordinates is discussed. Consequently one always generalizes theCartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this workwe introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentumoperator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out mostof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentumexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation valuereally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentumexpectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angularvariables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them asdynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation ofmotion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.
  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinearperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of avariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averagingmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrableequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known resultson the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trainsin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by theChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on thepropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the systemunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action ofvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain globalrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of theleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolatedsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due tononlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to anadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in theframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitarywaves in slowly varying media.
  If $\mu$ is a finite complex measure in the complex plane $\C$ we denote by$C^\mu$ its Cauchy integral defined in the sense of principal value. Themeasure $\mu$ is called reflectionless if it is continuous (has no atoms) and$C^\mu=0$ at $\mu$-almost every point. We show that if $\mu$ is reflectionlessand its Cauchy maximal function $C^\mu_*$ is summable with respect to $|\mu|$then $\mu$ is trivial. An example of a reflectionless measure whose maximalfunction belongs to the "weak" $L^1$ is also constructed, proving that theabove result is sharp in its scale. We also give a partial geometricdescription of the set of reflectionless measures on the line and discussconnections of our results with the notion of sets of finite perimeter in thesense of De Giorgi.
  The non-equilibrium zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in the tunneling density ofstates of a diffusive metallic film is studied. An effective action describingvirtual fluctuations out-of-equilibrium is derived. The singular behavior ofthe equilibrium ZBA is smoothed out by real processes of inelastic scattering.
  Activated dynamics in a glassy system undergoing steady shear deformation isstudied by numerical simulations. Our results show that the external drivingforce has a strong influence on the barrier crossing rate, even though thereaction coordinate is only weakly coupled to the nonequilibrium system. This"driven activation" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrheniusexpression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined fromthe fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported byanalytical results for a simplified model system.
  The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundaryconditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlationfunction, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of thiscorrelation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant andmultiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapesof the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we showthat for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phasediagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix modelwith a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-pointanalysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and itsgeneralization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.
  The extraction of the weak phase $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays has beencontroversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesianconfrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have notdeserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$.Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. Weshow that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless orinadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: thesingle weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospinrelations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is norelevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The mostrelevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary NewPhysics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.
  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theoryof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematicalview-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenbergequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition foruniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to someclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some theirgeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validityof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenbergequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem issolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normalordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That impliescorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introductionof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutationrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variablesis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposedthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuummean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as theonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do notcontradict to the existing data.
  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The pistonseparates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unitmass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averagingtechniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge inprobability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded andthe number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointedout that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove thatthe rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averagedbehavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. Theconvergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We alsoinvestigate the piston system when the particle interactions have beensmoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistonsseparating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion ofaveraging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averagingresults. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theoremfor smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.
  We review the general relativistic theory of the motion, and of the timing,of binary systems containing compact objects (neutron stars or black holes).Then we indicate the various ways one can use binary pulsar data to test thestrong-field and/or radiative aspects of General Relativity, and of generalclasses of alternative theories of relativistic gravity.
  GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions andmergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails,tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidalarm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-massgrazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation anddouble cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a looseassemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tailsand clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared tolocal antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisionsamong early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Mosttidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in thegas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated intothe arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although theirseparations are about the same. If they all form by gravitationalinstabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxieshave to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gascolumn densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.
  Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that doesnot satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In thispaper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms ofhalf integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theoremwe derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces ofsingular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman'sconjecture for overpartitions.
  The model considered in the paper is used nowadays to describe spin dynamicsof quantum dots after optical excitation. Based on the exact diagonalization ofa model Hamiltonian, we solve the problems of the electron spin polarizationdecay and magnetic field dependence of the steady state polarization. Theimportant role of the nuclear state is shown and methods of its calculation fordifferent regimes of optical excitation are proposed. The effect of spin echoobserved after application of the magnetic field $\pi$-pulse is predicted.
  We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$, for thefirst time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties bymeasuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specificheat. We found that CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at$T_{\rm N}$ = 4.6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data revealstrong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at $T$ = 2 Kexhibited two metamagnetic transitions at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 31 kOe and $H_{\rmm2}$ = 44.7 kOe, for $H \parallel$ [100] with a saturation magnetization of 1.6$\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce. The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inversesusceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited statesof CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state.The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spacedenergy levels.
  It is a brief review on composing and solving Infrared Evolution Equations.They can be used in order to calculate amplitudes of high-energy reactions indifferent kinematic regions in the double-logarithmic approximation.
  We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory.The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by thegravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry wasbroken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and theequation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. Itis remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case ofthe vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino oncosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handedneutrino variable.
  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas withtunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pairwave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified bythe correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation andannihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for athree-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function areexamined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On theside with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described byODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also foundthat at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where morethan 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.
  We report on the realization of a time-domain `St\"uckelberg interferometer',which is based on the internal state structure of ultracold Feshbach molecules.Two subsequent passages through a weak avoided crossing between two differentorbital angular momentum states in combination with a variable hold time leadto high-contrast population oscillations. This allows for a precisedetermination of the energy difference between the two molecular states. Wedemonstrate a high degree of control over the interferometer dynamics. Theinterferometric scheme provides new possibilities for precision measurementswith ultracold molecules.
  We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of asupported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both withand without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results ofrecent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature ofa supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particlewith the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the casewhen the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles aresimilar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface meltingbegins.
  In their recent paper, Campana et al. (2007) found that 5 bursts, among thosedetected by Swift, are outliers with respect to the E_peak-E_gamma("Ghirlanda") correlation. We instead argue that they are not.
  We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newtonof the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excessemission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the softexcess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII linesin the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newtonobservations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at theposition of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significantazimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equallywell with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution isneither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor withmodels of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Usingthe data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do notconfirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expectedproperties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observedproperties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermalinterpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associatedwith the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have beenprovided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlyingpopulation might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.
  Context: The object HS 0922+1333 was visited briefly in 2002 in a mini surveyof low accretion rate polars (LARPs) in order to test if they undergo highluminosity states similar to ordinary polars. On the basis of that shortobservation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spinperiod appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observationsof the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopicand photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements ofradial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star andbrightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbitaland spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source ofconfusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emissionline arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.
  We present results illustrating the effects of using explicit summation termsfor the $r^{-6}$ dispersion term on the interfacial properties of aLennard-Jones fluid and SPC/E water. For the Lennard-Jones fluid, we find thatthe use of long-range summations, even with a short ``crossover radius,''yields results that are consistent with simulations using large cutoff radii.Simulations of SPC/E water demonstrate that the long-range dispersion forcesare of secondary importance to the Coulombic forces. In both cases, we findthat the ratio of box size $L_{\parallel}$ to crossover radius $r_{\rmc}^{\mathbf k}$ plays an important role in determining the magnitude of thelong-range dispersion correction, although its effect is secondary whenCoulombic interactions are also present.
  I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using thedynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations(non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting andincorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximationis expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than thebandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter arecalculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyondMigdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter showsmomentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave orderis suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation toHohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.
  We compute exactly the semi-classical radiation spectrum for a class ofnon-asymptotically flat charged dilaton black holes, the so-called lineardilaton black holes. In the high frequency regime, the temperature for theseblack holes generically agrees with the surface gravity result. In the specialcase where the black hole is massless, we show that, although the surfacegravity remains finite, there is no radiation, in agreement with the fact thatmassless objects cannot radiate.
  Triggered by the demand of the IAEA, neutrino physicists in Europe involvedwith the Double Chooz experiment are studying the potential of neutrinodetection to monitor nuclear reactors. In particular a new set of experimentsat the ILL is planned to improve the knowledge of the neutrino spectrum emittedin the fission of 235U and 239Pu.
  The polarized neutron scattering in helimagnetic MnSi at low $T$ revealsexistence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in themagnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition tothe non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained bythe analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of thespin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competitionbetween the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative signmeans an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to adestruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered statebelow the first order ferromagnetic transition.
  We prove an Alexander type theorem for the spectral unit ball $\Omega_n$showing that there are no non-trivial proper holomorphic mappings in$\Omega_n$, $n\geq 2$.
  This paper presents a measurement-based availability assessment study usingfield data collected during a 4-year period from 373 SunOS/Solaris Unixworkstations and servers interconnected through a local area network. We focuson the estimation of machine uptimes, downtimes and availability based on theidentification of failures that caused total service loss. Data corresponds tosyslogd event logs that contain a large amount of information about the normalactivity of the studied systems as well as their behavior in the presence offailures. It is widely recognized that the information contained in such eventlogs might be incomplete or imperfect. The solution investigated in this paperto address this problem is based on the use of auxiliary sources of dataobtained from wtmpx files maintained by the SunOS/Solaris Unix operatingsystem. The results obtained suggest that the combined use of wtmpx and syslogdlog files provides more complete information on the state of the target systemsthat is useful to provide availability estimations that better reflect reality.
  In this note we consider the time of the collision $\tau$ for $n$ independentBrownian motions $X^1_t,...,X_t^n$ with drifts $a_1,...,a_n$, each startingfrom $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where $x_1<...<x_n$. We show the exact asymptotics of$P_x(\tau>t) = C h(x)t^{-\alpha}e^{-\gamma t}(1 + o(1))$ as $t\to\infty$ andidentify $C,h(x),\alpha,\gamma$ in terms of the drifts.
  We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation ofstatistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale,nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, thisapproach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of whichmay not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introducestatistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significantcomputational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom andmay be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method canin principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, includingstrongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which theremay be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach forimplementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochasticpartial differential equation.
  We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH'emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRSspectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAHfeatures and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lowerluminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs,supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's hugefar-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf'speriod of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with anintense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time~3E7yr) star forming event.
  We have obtained CCD BVI imaging of the old open clusters Berkeley 32 andKing 11. Using the synthetic colour-magnitude diagram method with threedifferent sets of stellar evolution models of various metallicities, with andwithout overshooting, we have determined their age, distance, reddening, andindicative metallicity, as well as distance from the Galactic centre and heightfrom the Galactic plane. The best parameters derived for Berkeley 32 are:subsolar metallicity (Z=0.008 represents the best choice, Z=0.006 or 0.01 aremore marginally acceptable), age = 5.0-5.5 Gyr (models with overshooting;without overshooting the age is 4.2-4.4 Gyr with poorer agreement),(m-M)_0=12.4-12.6, E(B-V)=0.12-0.18 (with the lower value being more probablebecause it corresponds to the best metallicity), Rgc ~ 10.7-11 kpc, and |Z| ~231-254 pc. The best parameters for King 11 are: Z=0.01, age=3.5-4.75 Gyr,(m-M)_0=11.67-11.75, E(B-V)=1.03-1.06, Rgc ~ 9.2-10 kpc, and |Z| ~ 253-387 pc.
  We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses ofelectrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch anglediffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism andalso emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. Asemi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviourof the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with theparticle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission ofrelativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, arediscussed.
  The present status and understanding of the "spectral sequence" of blazars isdiscussed in the perspective of the upcoming GLAST launch. The vast improvementin sensitivity will allow to i) determine more objectively the "average"gamma-ray properties of classes objects ii) probe more deeply the ratio betweenaccretion power and jet power in different systems.
  A search for the pair production of fourth generation b'-quarks was performedusing data taken by the DELPHI detector at LEP-II. The analysed data werecollected at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 196 to 209 GeV, correspondingto an integrated luminosity of 420 pb^{-1}. No evidence for a signal was found.Upper limits on BR(b' -> bZ) and BR(b' -> cW) were obtained for b' massesranging from 96 to 103 GeV/c^2. These limits, together with the theoreticalbranching ratios predicted by a sequential four generations model, were used toconstrain the value of R_{CKM}=|V_{cb'}/V_{tb'}V_{tb}|, where V_{cb'}, V_{tb'}and V_{tb} are elements of the extended CKM matrix.
  We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham evenand odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principlemore complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equationswith external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations.We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits atreatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. Inparticular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by usinga current with a one point support.
  We present new predictions for the galaxy three-point correlation function(3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flatLCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realisticmock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halosand subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity andcolor in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color arevaried, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of thereduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements fromthe SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCFmeasurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. Weexplore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurementslends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDMhalos and subhalos.
  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on aninfinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring iscomprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structurecoefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call theLittlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for theircalculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The newrule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive inthe sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of theproduct of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies astability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positiveformula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by usingcombinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent fromthat formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe themultiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the generallinear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.Okounkov and G. Olshanski.
  We report on measurements of the transverse fluctuations of a string in aturbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating dragforce, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes itpossible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged overspace and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure thedissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of thefluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigatethe concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compareour observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From thetheory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for thespectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental resultsare in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds numberaccessible ($74000 \leq Re \leq 170000$).
  New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects onneutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the threeflavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrinooscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy modeis aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable ofconstraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum valueof \sin^2 2\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss howsuch a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants andmasses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.
  Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support eitherleaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leakysurface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagationdirection of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connectionbetween the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of thecorresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability)so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of theimpinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can beexplained by the excitation of these leaky modes.
  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of anearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the "normal" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named "nearly horizon-skimming orbits". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclinationchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits arenot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveformsexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamondchains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique isinvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while thetransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explorethe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlationfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state forthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaksat wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zeromagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetizationplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of thezero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linearsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It isobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations ofthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of thesusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where thepeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of thecouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplingsleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetizationfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared withour TMRG results.
  For an arbitrary operator A on a Banach space X which is a generator ofC_0-group with certain growth condition at the infinity, the direct theorems onconnection between the smoothness degree of a vector $x\in X$ with respect tothe operator A, the order of convergence to zero of the best approximation of xby exponential type entire vectors for the operator A, and the k-module ofcontinuity are given. Obtained results allows to acquire Jackson-typeinequalities in many classic spaces of periodic functions and weighted $L_p$spaces.
  The well-known correlations of low-energy three and four-nucleon observableswith a typical three-nucleon scale (e.g., the Tjon line) is extended to lightnuclei and nuclear matter. Evidence for the scaling between light nucleibinding energies and the triton one are pointed out. We argue that thesaturation energy and density of nuclear matter are correlated to the tritonbinding energy. The available systematic nuclear matter calculations indicate apossible band structure representing these correlations.
  We provide several equivalent characterizations of Kobayashi hyperbolicity inunbounded convex domains in terms of peak and anti-peak functions at infinity,affine lines, Bergman metric and iteration theory.
  We estimate the spin relaxation rate due to spin-orbit coupling and acousticphonon scattering in weakly-confined quantum dots with up to five interactingelectrons. The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account forthe inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplingsare exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction stronglyaffects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation ratesstrongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify themechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2)quantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, wediscuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subjectto external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with theexperimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spinrelaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phononemission.
  A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly froma master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describephenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalousdiffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation ischaracterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, twodistinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate thestationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, andintroduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy theH-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transitionrates of the original master-equation are related to such generalizedentropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases arediscussed.
  We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of models of lattice polygons, mainly onthe square lattice. In particular, we focus on limiting area laws in theuniform perimeter ensemble where, for fixed perimeter, each polygon of a givenarea occurs with the same probability. We relate limit distributions to thescaling behaviour of the associated perimeter and area generating functions,thereby providing a geometric interpretation of scaling functions. To a majorextent, this article is a pedagogic review of known results.
  We prove the existence of global Bishop discs in a strictly pseudoconvexStein domain in an almost complex manifold of complex dimension 2.
  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge ofsingle electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit'sparameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describingdynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We foundthat in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates aredirectly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relationholds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuatingenvironment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship nolonger holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold eitherin the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. Inaddition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in thestrong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.
  In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding ofthe combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms ofFeynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopfalgebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrasedalgebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the wayto Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recentprogress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sectorusing the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relationto algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals asperiods of mixed (Tate) motives.
  In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful propertiesof the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] leftfactorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of theseresults and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, wediscuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions.
  We present a method to construct semi-numerical ``simulations'', which canefficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps athigh redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach withfirst-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the lineardensity and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with ouralgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders ofmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, wherethe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-findingand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations withradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the sizedistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even largerionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted meanhydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cmbrightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time includecorrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tailsof the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though theseeffects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include somepreliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range todate: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. Weshow that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires suchlarge scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numericalapproach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formationand reionization.
  The paper presents a survey of mathematical problems, techniques, andchallenges arising in the Thermoacoustic and Photoacoustic Tomography.
  We review applications of random matrix theory to QCD at nonzero temperatureand chemical potential. The chiral phase transition of QCD and QCD-liketheories is discussed in terms of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. We showthat for QCD at $\mu \ne 0$, which has a sign problem, the discontinuity in thechiral condensate is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher relation. Theseverity of the sign problem is analyzed in the microscopic domain of QCD.
  We provide a quantum analysis of a DC SQUID mechanical displacement detectorwithin the sub-critical Josephson current regime. A segment of the SQUID loopforms the mechanical resonator and motion of the latter is transducedinductively through changes in the flux threading the loop. Expressions arederived for the detector signal response and noise, which are used to evaluatethe position and force detection sensitivity. We also investigate cooling ofthe mechanical resonator due to back reaction noise from the detector.
  The physical consistency of the match of piecewise-$C^0$ metrics isdiscussed. The mathematical theory of gravitational discontinuity hypersurfacesis generalized to cover the match of regularly discontinuous metrics. Themean-value differential geometry framework on a hypersurface is introduced, andcorresponding compatibility conditions are deduced. Examples of generalizedboundary layers, gravitational shock waves and thin shells are studied.
  A new method, FM-FTS, combining Frequency Modulation heterodyne laserspectroscopy and Fourier Transform Spectroscopy is presented. It providessimultaneous sensitive measurement of absorption and dispersion profiles withbroadband spectral coverage capabilities. Experimental demonstration is made onthe overtone spectrum of C2H2 in the 1.5 $\mu$m region.
  In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation ofelectronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive theexclusion principle "Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotentialsurface simultaneously" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. Wepropose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundarycondition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for thenon-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition wasapplied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2,O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground stateenergies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativisticenergies.
  We construct general 2-charge D1-D5 horizon-free non-singular solutions ofIIB supergravity on T^4 and K3 describing fuzzballs with excitations in theinternal manifold; these excitations are characterized by arbitrary curves. Thesolutions are obtained via dualities from F1-P solutions of heterotic and typeIIB on T^4 for the K3 and T^4 cases, respectively. We compute the holographicdata encoded in these solutions, and show that the internal excitations arecaptured by vevs of chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology ofT^4 or K3. We argue that each geometry is dual to a specific superposition of Rground states determined in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the curvesdefining the supergravity solution. We compute vevs of chiral primariesassociated with the middle cohomology and show that they indeed acquire vevs inthe superpositions corresponding to fuzzballs with internal excitations, inaccordance with the holographic results. We also address the question ofwhether the fuzzball program can be implemented consistently withinsupergravity.
  By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, inultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS)population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very centralregions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in thecluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such abimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globularclusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulationssuggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellarcollisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transferprocesses in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radialdistribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidalradius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an"evaporating" BSS.
  We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activationin the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a seriesof simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulationof the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulationtime-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum.The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensionalLangevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply toboth Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to severalexperimental tests in such optical systems.
  The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can beused to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We provethat the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense whichis stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show thatthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while theoutradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a relatedmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is aEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the totalmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pir^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and theoutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgneand Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.
  We fully elucidate the structure of the hierarchy of the connected operatorsthat commute with the Markov matrix of the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process(TASEP). We prove for the connected operators a combinatorial formula that wasconjectured in a previous work. Our derivation is purely algebraic and relieson the algebra generated by the local jump operators involved in the TASEP.  Keywords: Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, ASEP, Exact Results,Algebraic Bethe Ansatz.
  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade toincrease channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacityfor mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from eachnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussianvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty papercoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vectorbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamentalresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fillthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation inthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based meshnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challengingnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the originalproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For thetransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integratesLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection methodbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradientmethod. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a networkperformance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.
  We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory tomeasure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) inthe nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr,which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocitydispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive thekinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globularclusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCsare a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass functionfor the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in theAntennae galaxies.
  We investigate the enhancement in the D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0 final state with themass M=3875.2\pm 0.7^{+0.3}_{-1.6}\pm 0.8 MeV found recently by the BelleCollaboration in the B\to K D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0 decay and test the possibilitythat this is yet another manifestation of the well-established resonanceX(3872). We perform a combined Flatte analysis of the data for theD^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0 mode, and for the \pi^+\pi^- J/\psi mode of the X(3872). Onlyif the X(3872) is a virtual state in the D^0\bar{D}^{*0} channel, the data onthe new enhancement comply with those on the X(3872). In our fits, the massdistribution in the D^0\bar{D}^{*0} mode exhibits a peak at 2-3 MeV above theD^0\bar{D}^{*0} threshold, with a distinctive non-Breit-Wigner shape.
  A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly largevorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. Thefast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied forparametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami wavesdeplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems ofthree-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of theseresonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of thesehomoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolevnorms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.
  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeterwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried outwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlssonand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive todynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to lookfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggeststhat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided byALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the coolgas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models ofthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations ofthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) revealsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longerperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as thatprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the featureswithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output ofthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.
  The constrained-search formulation of Levy and Lieb, which formally definesthe exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional for any N-representable electron density,is here shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the correlationfunctional with respect to the N-1 conditional probability density, where N isnumber of electrons of the system. The consequences and implications of such aresult are here analyzed and discussed via a practical example.
  We investigate the approach to stable and metastable equilibrium in Isingmodels using a cluster representation. The distribution of nucleation times isdetermined using the Metropolis algorithm and the corresponding $\phi^{4}$model using Langevin dynamics. We find that the nucleation rate is suppressedat early times even after global variables such as the magnetization and energyhave apparently reached their time independent values. The mean number ofclusters whose size is comparable to the size of the nucleating droplet becomestime independent at about the same time that the nucleation rate reaches itsconstant value. We also find subtle structural differences between thenucleating droplets formed before and after apparent metastable equilibrium hasbeen established.
  As a continuation of Rabei et al. work [11], the Hamilton- Jacobi partialdifferential equation is generalized to be applicable for systems containingfractional derivatives. The Hamilton- Jacobi function in configuration space isobtained in a similar manner to the usual mechanics. Two problems areconsidered to demonstrate the application of the formalism. The result found tobe in exact agreement with Agrawal's formalism.
  A celebrated result of F. Jaeger states that the Tutte polynomial of a planargraph is determined by the HOMFLY polynomial of an associated link. Here we areinterested in the converse of this result. We consider the question `to whatextent does the Tutte polynomial determine the HOMFLY polynomial of any knot?'We show that the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot is determined by Tutte polynomialsof plane graphs associated to the knot.
  We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biasedrandom walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectraldimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine.Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random combwith nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on thespine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. Wealso analyze transport properties along the spine for these probabilitymeasures.
  We present an analysis of the percolation transition for general node removalstrategies valid for locally tree-like directed networks. On the basis ofheuristic arguments we predict that, if the probability of removing node $i$ is$p_i$, the network disintegrates if $p_i$ is such that the largest eigenvalueof the matrix with entries $A_{ij}(1-p_i)$ is less than 1, where $A$ is theadjacency matrix of the network. The knowledge or applicability of a Markovnetwork model is not required by our theory, thus making it applicable tosituations not covered by previous works. We test our predicted percolationcriterion against numerical results for different networks and node removalstrategies.
  A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Methodis proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteinsand their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model,proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volumedefined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Elementrepresentation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm thatfacilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatialresolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant ofT4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Eulerbuckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results comparefavorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocksprocedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computationalframework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitatesthe incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure isequally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is toelectron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecularassemblies of unknown atomic structure.
  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based onopportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance indense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQtransmission approach where relays forward parity information to thedestination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with thebest channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap byadding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selectionproblem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback isnecessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varyingkey parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback thresholdis discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates theimportance of relay selection.
  We perform the first three-dimensional measurement of the amplitudes of $B\to\psi(2S) K^*$ and $B\to \chi_{c1} K^*$ decays and update our previousmeasurement for $B\to J/\psi K^*$. We use a data sample collected with theBaBar detector at the PEP2 storage ring, corresponding to 232 million $B\bar B$pairs. The longitudinal polarization of decays involving a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$$\chi_{c1}$ meson is found to be larger than that with a $1^{--}$ $J/\psi$ or$\psi(2S)$ meson. No direct {\it CP}-violating charge asymmetry is observed.
  In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking inthe Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleonflavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure ofconstituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emissionprocess in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$,the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then theobtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from aquark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking innucleon flavor-spin structure.
  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which thecomplexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments neededfor its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by theentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function ofexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due tointegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancyis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data aboutthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation ofthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information andinformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity ofthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experimentsneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the costfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics isdemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.
  We study the Dirichlet problem associated to the equation for self-similarsurfaces for graphs over the Euclidean plane with a disk removed. We show theexistence of a solution provided the boundary conditions on the boundary circleare small enough and satisfy some symmetries. This is the second step towardsthe construction of new examples of complete embedded self similar surfacesunder mean curvature flow.
  Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but alsoexhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions arecomparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic"fingerprints" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain tovortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. Asthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams revealstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresisloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivitydistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with acalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nmnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of thevortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution andconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method givesquantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleationand annihilation fields.
  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO whitedwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use anelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles thanearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the centralregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of aslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by acentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant thatmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamicstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellarevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled byneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, andthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effectiveaccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretionof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of doubleCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply thatat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered goodcandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, thecharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventualexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).
  We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudito evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,incorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on thedetectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitudelimits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budgeton transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shapedtransits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies asteep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, whenconsidered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limitthe potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we findthat small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radialvelocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby(<100 pc) clusters.
  Three types of integral representations for the cumulative distributionfunctions of convolutions of non-central p-variate gamma distributions aregiven by integration of elementary complex functions over the p-cube Cp =(-pi,pi]x...x(-pi,pi]. In particular, the joint distribution of the diagonalelements of a generalized quadratic form XAX' with n independent normallydistributed column vectors in X is obtained. For a single p-variate gammadistribution function (p-1)-variate integrals over Cp-1 are derived. Theintegrals are numerically more favourable than integrals obtained from theFourier or laplace inversion formula.
  We introduce a new class of "random" subsets of natural numbers, WM sets.This class contains normal sets (sets whose characteristic function is a normalbinary sequence). We establish necessary and sufficient conditions forsolvability of systems of linear equations within every WM set and within everynormal set. We also show that partition-regular system of linear equations withinteger coefficients is solvable in any WM set.
  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of thediscrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this techniquewas studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases usingmany different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves withrefining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially forcubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error wasdemonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which wereproven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separateshape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.
  One-dimensional scattering problem admitting a complex, PT-symmetricshort-range potential V(x) is considered. Using a Runge-Kutta-discretizedversion of Schroedinger equation we derive the formulae for the reflection andtransmission coefficients and emphasize that the only innovation emerges infact via a complexification of one of the potential-characterizing parameters.
  We study pentaquark $\Theta^{+} (I=0,J=1/2)$ in the QCD sum rules emphasizingthat we can not extract any properties of the pentaquark outside of the Borelwindow. To find the appropriate Borel window, we prepare a favorable set up ofthe correlators and carry out the operator product expansion up to dimension 15within factorization hypothesis. Our procedures reduce the unwanted high energycontaminations and enhance the low energy correlation. In the Borel window,independent analyses for the chiral-even and odd sum rules give the consistentvalues of the $\Theta^+$ mass, $1.68\pm0.22$ GeV, and the residue. The parityis found to be {\it positive}.
  The historical significance of the problem of relativistic rigid rotation isreviewed in light of recently published correspondence between Einstein and themathematician Vladimir Varicak from the years 1909 to 1913.
  We show that recent stock market fluctuations are characterized by thecumulative distributions whose tails on short, minute time scales exhibit powerscaling with the scaling index alpha > 3 and this index tends to increasequickly with decreasing sampling frequency. Our study is based onhigh-frequency recordings of the S&P500, DAX and WIG20 indices over theinterval May 2004 - May 2006. Our findings suggest that dynamics of thecontemporary market may differ from the one observed in the past. This effectindicates a constantly increasing efficiency of world markets.
  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlationeffects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regimewhere itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlationsand static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find severalinteresting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in thespectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectralfunction for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Sincethe optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectralfunction, we show that such a regime should be observable through the lowfrequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a doublekondo peak arrangement
  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutationrelations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation hasgained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planckscale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetricsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we exploredifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory andthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derivethe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theoryand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In thesecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverseprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover backthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples ofinterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simplecosmological model.
  We consider the curvature of a family of warped products of twopseduo-Riemannian manifolds $(B,g_B)$ and $(F,g_F)$ furnished with metrics ofthe form $c^{2}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$ and, in particular, of the type $w^{2\mu}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$, where $c, w \colon B \to (0,\infty)$ are smoothfunctions and $\mu$ is a real parameter. We obtain suitable expressions for theRicci tensor and scalar curvature of such products that allow us to establishresults about the existence of Einstein or constant scalar curvature structuresin these categories. If $(B,g_B)$ is Riemannian, the latter question involvesnonlinear elliptic partial differential equations with concave-convexnonlinearities and singular partial differential equations of theLichnerowicz-York type among others.
  We study birational maps with empty base locus defined by almost completeintersection ideals. Birationality is shown to be expressed by the equality oftwo Chern numbers. We provide a relatively effective method of theircalculation in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients. In dimension two thestructure of the irreducible ideals leads naturally to the calculation ofSylvester determinants via a computer-assisted method. For degree at most 5 weproduce the full set of defining equations of the base ideal. The resultsanswer affirmatively some questions raised by D. Cox.
  Aims: We analyze the available information on the star BD+43 3654 toinvestigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OBassociation Cygnus OB2.  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliablespectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations ofits associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminousstar of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar massesand an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSXobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of thesky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matcheswell the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its pathacross the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densestregion of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runawaystars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. Arunaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent withour results.
  We numerically study Barrett-Crane models of Riemannian quantum gravity. Wehave extended the existing numerical techniques to handle q-deformed models andarbitrary space-time triangulations. We present and interpret expectationvalues of a few selected observables for each model, including a spin-spincorrelation function which gives insight into the behaviour of the models. Wefind the surprising result that, as the deformation parameter q goes to 1through roots of unity, the limit is discontinuous.
  Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both}positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weightededge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find abipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem hasvarious applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide rangeof choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max\mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial timealgorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result givesjustification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problemsin the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithmsare unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists forthe Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless$\mathsf{RP=NP}$.
  Cloaking devices are prescriptions of electrostatic, optical orelectromagnetic parameter fields (conductivity $\sigma(x)$, index of refraction$n(x)$, or electric permittivity $\epsilon(x)$ and magnetic permeability$\mu(x)$) which are piecewise smooth on $\mathbb R^3$ and singular on ahypersurface $\Sigma$, and such that objects in the region enclosed by $\Sigma$are not detectable to external observation by waves. Here, we give relatedconstructions of invisible tunnels, which allow electromagnetic waves to passbetween possibly distant points, but with only the ends of the tunnels visibleto electromagnetic imaging. Effectively, these change the topology of spacewith respect to solutions of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to attaching ahandlebody to $\mathbb R^3$. The resulting devices thus function aselectromagnetic wormholes.
  We derive quasiclassical expressions for the three-body decay width anddefine the ``preexponential'' coefficients for them. The derivation is based onthe integral formulae for the three-body width obtained in the semianalyticalapproach with simplified three-body Hamiltonian [L.V. Grigorenko and M.V.\Zhukov, arXiv:0704.0920v1]. The model is applied to the decays of the firstexcited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and $3/2^{-}$ ground state of $^{45}$Fe.Various qualitative aspects of the model and relations with the othersimplified approaches to the three-body decays are discussed.
  We propose a scheme for generating squeezed states in solid state circuitsconsisting of a nanomechanical resonator (NMR), a superconducting Cooper-pairbox (CPB) and a superconducting transmission line resonator (STLR). Thenonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented bysetting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interactionHamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\rm\ddoto$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just byadiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standardparametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinearmedia", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a mannersimilar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wavemixing in a solid-state circuit.
  Moore introduced a class of real-valued "recursive" functions by analogy withKleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concisedefinition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it containssome technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his "primitive recursive" functions,we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove theambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator onpartial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation todifferentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analogcomputation, fails.
  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures ofdomains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probabilitybecause of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochasticnetworks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains anddirections of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, forSRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process thatsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations inthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucialingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality forsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle toshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invarianceprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give somesufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs inconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of thepolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundariesand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.
  We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence ofspinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles underthe combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, fordifferent combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find thatthe magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropyaxes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degreeflips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolarinteraction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures,antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading toaging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition,these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disorderedstructures.
  A solution is given to the following problem: how to compute themultiplicity, or more generally the Hilbert function, at a point on a Schubertvariety in an orthogonal Grassmannian. Standard monomial theory is applied totranslate the problem from geometry to combinatorics. The solution of theresulting combinatorial problem forms the bulk of the paper. This approach hasbeen followed earlier to solve the same problem for the Grassmannian and thesymplectic Grassmannian.  As an application, we present an interpretation of the multiplicity as thenumber of non-intersecting lattice paths of a certain kind.  Taking the Schubert variety to be of a special kind and the point to be the"identity coset," our problem specializes to a problem about Pfaffian idealstreatments of which by different methods exist in the literature. Alsoavailable in the literature is a geometric solution when the point is a"generic singularity."
  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of thetheory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (orintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and mostcommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent ofthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constantcurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The globaldefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Variousrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finslermanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are provedglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interestingidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and thecurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirelyglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a localcounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the specialFinsler spaces considered.
  A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalizedYang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those whichpresent black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system isthermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons tocoalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shownthat eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance doesnot. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed andidentified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this newspacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radiiof spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type termshould be present in the line element or not, are also included.
  The low energy spectra of some gamma-ray bursts' show excess componentsbeside the power-law dependence. The consequences of such a feature allows toestimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in theBATSE Catalog. There is good correlation between the measured optical and theestimated gamma photometric redshifts. The estimated redshift values for thelong bright gamma-ray bursts are up to z=4, while for the the faint long bursts- which should be up to z=20 - the redshifts cannot be determined unambiguouslywith this method. The redshift distribution of all the gamma-ray bursts withknown optical redshift agrees quite well with the BATSE based gamma photometricredshift distribution.
  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes intheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from thecircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks hasbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of theouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting inaccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifestitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present asearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopicbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find thatthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. Thebrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overallperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more thanhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not asclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic componentis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement withpredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar tothose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur fromcircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending thetimescale over which they might form planets.
  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters usingN-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in thesemodels range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code andinclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution andthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed inthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination ofmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions producesthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycledinto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection instars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radiusup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by theexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% orless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordialbinary content of globular clusters.
  In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations forthe extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process by using theGr\"obner basis.
  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggesteddensity matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemblein quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one)distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of theobservable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the{\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtainedcosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmologicalconstant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stagesof expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained withinthe concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with thebounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemblesuggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form ofthe quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.
  We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of anarray of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system(atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing andphotonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in thearray. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual railquantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at thereceiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communicationis also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connectedcavities.
  The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while PartII discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of twosimultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures isa difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes anintelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprisesa sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves thelocation problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance wastested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy oflocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, thedimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The locationaccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained bythe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of theintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths isavoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraftframe structures by the acoustic emission method.
  We model the essential features of eternal inflation on the landscape of adense discretuum of vacua by the potential $V(\phi)=V_{0}+\delta V(\phi)$,where $|\delta V(\phi)|\ll V_{0}$ is random. We find that the diffusion of thedistribution function $\rho(\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value indifferent Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to theAnderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \to \infty$ only thelocalized part of the distribution function $\rho (\phi, t)$ survives whichleads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability tomeasure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubblepatch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\to \infty$.
  Five dimensional neutral rotating black rings are described from aRandall-Sundrum brane world perspective in the bulk black string framework. Tothis end we consider a rotating black string extension of a five dimensionalblack ring into the bulk of a six dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world witha single four brane. The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a fivedimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. Thebulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring areconstructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual blackring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulkgeodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdShorizon. We further discuss the description of a brane world black ring as alimit of a boosted bulk black 2 brane with periodic identification.
  We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finitedensity. In particular we compute the energy density as a function of thechemical potential and the temperature. It is shown that overlap fermions withchemical potential reproduce the correct continuum behavior.
  We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locallycompact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of thegeometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we showthat any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Liegroup S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have anasymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to alimiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discussthe speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application toergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariantmetrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth seriesof nilpotent groups.
  A general formulation was developed to represent material models forapplications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculateresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizingprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods werefound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a highaccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve forcomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shockinteractions with a planar interface between different materials. Thesecalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamicsexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Examplecalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effectsof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic andshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
  An overview is presented of laser spectroscopy experiments with cold,trapped, highly-charged ions, which will be performed at the HITRAP facility atGSI in Darmstadt (Germany). These high-resolution measurements of ground statehyperfine splittings will be three orders of magnitude more precise thanprevious measurements. Moreover, from a comparison of measurements of thehyperfine splittings in hydrogen- and lithium-like ions of the same isotope,QED effects at high electromagnetic fields can be determined within a fewpercent. Several candidate ions suited for these laser spectroscopy studies arepresented.
  According to extensive experimental findings, the Ginzburg temperature$t_{G}$ for ionic fluids differs substantially from that of nonionic fluids[Schr\"oer W., Weig\"{a}rtner H. 2004 {\it Pure Appl. Chem.} {\bf 76} 19]. Atheoretical investigation of this outcome is proposed here by a mean fieldanalysis of the interplay of short and long range interactions on the value of$t_{G}$. We consider a quite general continuous charge-asymmetric model made ofcharged hard spheres with additional short-range interactions (withoutelectrostatic interactions the model belongs to the same universality class asthe 3D Ising model). The effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian of the fullsystem near its gas-liquid critical point is derived from which the Ginzburgtemperature is calculated as a function of the ionicity. The results obtainedin this way for $t_{G}$ are in good qualitative and sufficient quantitativeagreement with available experimental data.
  The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have beenstudied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0Hbetween 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-Visotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures showa scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortexglass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed downto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale interms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this maybe caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaledaccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalenteffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.
  We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in thepresence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreementwith previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to largeenhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonantlevels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we makeuse of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, thephotoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in theabsence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated foroligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure iscalculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponentialdecay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by alength-independent value in the presence of radiation.
  Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations ofthe Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamicallyconsistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well ascertain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown forvariational approximations that are generated within the framework of theself-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series.Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions underwhich the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation.Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-siteapproximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and theconsequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory arediscussed.
  Measurements of transport properties of amorphous insulating indium oxidethin films have been interpreted as evidence of the presence of superconductingislands on the insulating side of a disorder-tuned superconductor-insulatortransition. Although the films are not granular, the behavior is similar tothat observed in granular films. The results support theoretical models inwhich the destruction of superconductivity by disorder produces spatiallyinhomogenous pairing with a spectral gap.
  Let $\Dh$ and $A$ be unital and separable $C^{*}$-algebras; let $\Dh$ bestrongly self-absorbing. It is known that any two unital $^*$-homomorphismsfrom $\Dh$ to $A \otimes \Dh$ are approximately unitarily equivalent. We showthat, if $\Dh$ is also $K_{1}$-injective, they are even asymptoticallyunitarily equivalent. This in particular implies that any unital endomorphismof $\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\Dh$is compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that forany compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\Aut(\Dh)]$reduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unitalendomorphisms of $\Dh$. As an application, we give a description of theKasparov group $KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ in terms of $^*$-homomorphisms andasymptotic unitary equivalence. Along the way, we show that the Kasparov group$KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ is isomorphic to $K_0(A\ot \Dh)$.
  The effects of imperfect gate operations in implementation of Shor's primefactorization algorithm are investigated. The gate imperfections may beclassified into three categories: the systematic error, the random error, andthe one with combined errors. It is found that Shor's algorithm is robustagainst the systematic errors but is vulnerable to the random errors. Errorthreshold is given to the algorithm for a given number $N$ to be factorized.
  We review the current status of the theoretical pentaquark search from thedirect QCD calculation. The works from the QCD sum rule and the lattice QCD inthe literature are carefully examined. The importance of the framework whichcan distinguish the exotic pentaquark state (if any) from the NK scatteringstate is emphasized.
  We report a new effect of surfactants in pinning a drop contact line,specifically that lysozyme promotes while lauryl sulfate inhibits pinning. Weexplain the pinning disparity assuming difference in wetting: the protein-ladendrop wets a "clean" surface and the surfactant-laden drop wets anauto-precursored surface.
  Radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic jets of microquasars showevidence for the acceleration of particles to very high energies. Signatures ofnon-thermal processes occurring closer in to the compact object can also befound. In addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high (> 100MeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays. High-energy emission canoriginate from a microquasar jet (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsarwind (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the very nearfuture on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected to shed new light on thelink between accretion and ejection in microquasars and to enable to probepulsar winds on small scales in rotation-powered binaries.
  Exchange of quantum states between two interacting harmonic oscillator alongtheir evolution time is discussed. It is analyzed the conditions for suchexchange starting from a generic initial state and demonstrating that theeffect occurs exactly only for the particular states C0|0>+Cn|N>, whichincludes the interesting qubits components |0>,|1>. It is also determined therelation between the coupling constant and characteristic frequencies of theoscillators to have the complete exchange.
  Uniform measures are defined as the functionals on the space of boundeduniformly continuous functions that are continuous on bounded uniformlyequicontinuous sets. If every cardinal has measure zero then every countablyadditive measure is a uniform measure. The functionals sequentially continuouson bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets are exactly uniform measures on theseparable modification of the underlying uniform space.
  We study the late-time behavior of spherically symmetric solutions of theYang-Mills equations on Minkowski and Schwarzschild backgrounds. Usingnonlinear perturbation theory we show in both cases that solutions havingsmooth compactly supported initial data posses tails which decay as $t^{-4}$ attimelike infinity. Moreover, for small initial data on Minkowski background wederive the third-order formula for the amplitude of the tail and confirmnumerically its accuracy.
  Deformations of the 3-differential of 3-differential graded algebras arecontrolled by the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation. We find explicit formulae forthe coefficients appearing in that equation, introduce new geometric examplesof N-differential graded algebras, and use these results to study N Liealgebroids.
  We calculate the self-force acting on a particle with scalar charge moving ona generic geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole. This calculation requiresan accurate computation of the retarded scalar field produced by the movingcharge; this is done numerically with the help of a fourth-order convergentfinite-difference scheme formulated in the time domain. The calculation alsorequires a regularization procedure, because the retarded field is singular onthe particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sumregularization scheme first introduced by Barack and Ori. This paper presentsthe numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results formildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.
  Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical meanfield calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolvedspectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulatingphases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effectsprevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of thelatter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct anorbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the fullmany-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particledescription. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-oldquestion of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-bodyPeierls'' state.
  We show how a single trapped ion may be used to test a variety of importantphysical models realized as time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The ion itselffunctions as its own motional detector through laser-induced electronictransitions. Alsing et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220401 (2005)] proposed thatan exponentially decaying trap frequency could be used to simulate (thermal)Gibbons-Hawking radiation in an expanding universe, but the Hamiltonian usedwas incorrect. We apply our general solution to this experimental proposal,correcting the result for a single ion and showing that while the actualspectrum is different from the Gibbons-Hawking case, it nevertheless shares animportant experimental signature with this result.
  We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additionalconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (Theconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killinghorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warpedproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereaswarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted tothe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze thesimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions thatthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions aregeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admitnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples inany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type DWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with thoseof the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelikedirections of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxingthe twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. Then=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension arebriefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.
  The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and ourunderstanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of FundamentalForces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory ofRelativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition toproviding us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shownhow it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.
  Galactic rotation curves and lack of direct observations of Dark Matter mayindicate that General Relativity is not valid (on galactic scale) and should bereplaced with another theory. There is the only variant of Absolute Parallelismwhich solutions are free of arising singularities, if D=5 (there is no room forchanges). This variant does not have a Lagrangian, nor match GR: an equation of`plain' R^2-gravity (ie without R-term) is in sight instead. Arranging anexpanding O_4-symmetrical solution as the basis of 5D cosmological model, andprobing a universal_function of mass distribution (along very-very long theextra dimension) to place into bi-Laplace equation (R^2 gravity), one canderive the Law of Gravitation: 1/r^2 transforms to 1/r with distance (not withacceleration).
  In a 2002 paper, the authors and Bruner used the new spectrum tmf to obtainsome new nonimmersions of real projective spaces. In this note, wecomplete/correct two oversights in that paper.  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result wasstated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yetit was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here wegive a simple proof of those overlooked results.  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it wasclaimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recentlythat this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplicationby a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersionresults claimed in the original paper.  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\infty\timesRP^\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\infty\times CP^\infty) in positive dimensions.
  We review recent progress in operator algebraic approach to conformal quantumfield theory. Our emphasis is on use of representation theory in classificationtheory. This is based on a series of joint works with R. Longo.
  We present maps of 1.5 square degrees of the Serpens dark cloud at 24, 70,and 160\micron observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS Camera. More than2400 compact sources have been extracted at 24um, nearly 100 at 70um, and 4 at160um. We estimate completeness limits for our 24um survey from Monte Carlotests with artificial sources inserted into the Spitzer maps. We compare sourcecounts, colors, and magnitudes in the Serpens cloud to two reference data sets,a 0.50 deg^2 set on a low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3deg^2 subset of the SWIRE ELAIS N1 data that was processed through ourpipeline. These results show that there is an easily identifiable population ofyoung stellar object candidates in the Serpens Cloud that is not present ineither of the reference data sets. We also show a comparison of visualextinction and cool dust emission illustrating a close correlation between thetwo, and find that the most embedded YSO candidates are located in the areas ofhighest visual extinction.
  Description of a polynomial time reduction of SAT to 2-SAT of polynomialsize.
  We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators $L_{e_1},...,L_{e_n}, L_{f_1},...,L_{f_m}$ subject to the unitary commutation relations ofthe form \[ L_{e_i}L_{f_j} = \sum_{k,l} u_{i,j,k,l} L_{f_l}L_{e_k}\] where $u=(u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, whichgeneralise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a singlevertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$.
  Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization,and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZspin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of theaverage time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilonl^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed bythe prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorderdependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. Theorigin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in therenormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the averageentanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surfaceterms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of ourresults by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.
  Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scaleatomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results cruciallydepends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys likequasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practicallyinexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentialsespecially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called forcematching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as tooptimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosenreference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initiomethods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals havebeen constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree ofspecialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.
  Katz and Vafa showed how charged matter can arise geometrically by thedeformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, andF-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients,used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here todeform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturallycompliments many features of unified model building. We realize this ideaexplicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grandunified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Modelfields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complexstructure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing thearbitrariness of their relative positions.
  It is known that every closed curve of length \leq 4 in R^n (n>0) can besurrounded by a sphere of radius 1, and that this is the best bound. Letting Sdenote the circle of circumference 4, with the arc-length metric, we hereexpress this fact by saying that the "mapping radius" of S in R^n is 1.  Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X ina metric space Y. In particular, it is shown that for X a bounded metric space,the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metricspaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linearcombinations of the functions d(x,-): X --> R (x\in X).  Several explicit mapping radii are calculated, and open questions noted.
  We give a detailed microscopic derivation of gauge and stringy instantongenerated superpotentials for gauge theories living on D3-branes atZ_3-orientifold singularities. Gauge instantons are generated by D(-1)-branesand lead to Affleck, Dine and Seiberg (ADS) like superpotentials in theeffective N=1 gauge theories with three generations of bifundamental andanti/symmetric matter. Stringy instanton effects are generated by EuclideanED3-branes wrapping four-cycles on T^6/\Z_3. They give rise to Majorana massesin one case and non-renormalizable superpotentials for the other cases. Finallywe determine the conditions under which ADS like superpotentials are generatedin N=1 gauge theories with adjoints, fundamentals, symmetric and antisymmetricchiral matter.
  A theory of collective states in a magnetically quantized two-dimensionalelectron gas (2DEG) with half-filled Landau level (quantized Hall ferromagnet)in the presence of magnetic 3d impurities is developed. The spectrum of boundand delocalized spin-excitons as well as the renormalization of Zeemansplitting of the impurity 3d levels due to the indirect exchange interactionwith the 2DEG are studied for the specific case of n-type GaAs doped with Mnwhere the Lande` g-factors of impurity and 2DEG have opposite signs. If thesign of the 2DEG g-factor is changed due to external influences, then impurityrelated transitions to new ground state phases, presenting various spin-flipand skyrmion-like textures, are possible. Conditions for existence of thesephases are discussed. PACS: 73.43.Lp, 73.21.Fg, 72.15.Rn
  In this talk we discuss an elementary derivation of the semi-classicalspectrum of neutral particles in two field theories with kink excitations. Wealso show that, in the non-integrable cases, each vacuum state cannotgenerically support more than two stable particles, since all other neutralexitations are resonances, which will eventually decay.
  We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotentBecchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of theLagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-formgauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular,we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetryinvariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of thespecific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism.Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gaugetheories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalismwhere the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensionalsupermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu =0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One ofthe key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplificationin the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetryinvariance.
  The possibility of self-consistent determination of instanton liquidparameters is discussed together with the definition of optimal pseudo-particleconfigurations and comparing the various pseudo-particle ensembles. Theweakening of repulsive interactions between pseudo-particles is argued andestimated.
  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclicsingle-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata tocertain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate thedeterminant.
  It has been suggested that X-ray observations of rapidly variable Seyfertgalaxies may hold the key to probe the gas orbital motions in the innermostregions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patternsunder the effect of the hole strong gravitational field. We explore thispossibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783.A detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortestpossible time-scales (few ks) using "excess maps" and cross-correlating lightcurves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe Kalpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission featurebetween 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ksthat is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV sourcecontinuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Feline and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretiondisc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of theredshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line islikely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.
  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analysesundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distancemeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from diskobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halodark matter residing in such objects.  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo whitedwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed thestars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determinedyielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be toodistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in ourobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities werederived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halomembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may bethick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion basedsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometricparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance asderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revisethe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in asubsequent publication.
  Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators oftwo-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two,W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also beassociated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective spaceover the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2).An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads andspecific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the "classical" subsetsanswering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).
  We consider the defocusing, $\dot{H}^1$-critical Hartree equation for theradial data in all dimensions $(n\geq 5)$. We show the global well-posednessand scattering results in the energy space. The new ingredient in this paper isthat we first take advantage of the term $\displaystyle - \int_{I}\int_{|x|\leqA|I|^{1/2}}|u|^{2}\Delta \Big(\frac{1}{|x|}\Big)dxdt$ in the localized Morawetzidentity to rule out the possibility of energy concentration, instead of theclassical Morawetz estimate dependent of the nonlinearity.
  We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by atime-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie,Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can onlybe normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Eachcase can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. Wegive conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limitdistribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulantgenerating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model,a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.
  We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallowconfining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities,the electrons form a two-row (zigzag) Wigner crystal whose spin properties aredetermined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three-and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resultingzigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spinpolarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, includingantiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by thefour-particle ring exchange.
  On the basis of the Fermi liquid theory, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio$A/\gamma^2$ is evaluated by using a first principle band calculation fortypical itinerant $d$ and $f$ electron systems. It is found as observed thatthe ratio for the $d$ electron systems is significantly smaller than the normal$f$ systems, even without considering their relatively weak correlation. Thedifference in the ratio value comes from different characters of the Fermisurfaces. By comparing Pd and USn$_3$ as typical cases, we discuss theimportance of the Fermi surface dependence of the quasiparticle transportrelaxation.
  NGC 7679 is a nearby luminous infrared Sy2 galaxy in which starburst and AGNactivities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGNpower-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray sourcepossessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}. The Compton-thinnature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of theUnified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of thisarticle is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in thecircumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1nucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [OIII] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along thePA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum ofionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratiois displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that thedust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the centralAGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A largefraction of the unabsorbed Compton-thin Sy2s with [O III] luminosity > 10^41erg s^{-1} possesses a hidden AGN source (abridged).
  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluidflow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associatedwith a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bfr}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is thefluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value ofcirculation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentumis constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantizedvortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, includingsingle vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recentobservation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clearsignature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. Inaddition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinearoptics, and type-II superconductors.
  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Waydepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnovermass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMFimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does notdepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in theglobular cluster system.
  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonicdistributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet ofsize $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonicdistributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class containsfast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers andgeometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributionsover the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where amethod to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequenceis governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whoseempirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar tothose in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity inthe empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individualsequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihooddescription length may still be achievable.
  We employ dynamical mean-field theory to study the optical conductivity$\sigma(\omega)$ of one hole in the Holstein-t-J model. We provide an exactsolution for $\sigma(\omega)$ in the limit of infinite connectivity. We applyour analysis to Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We show that our model can explainmany features of the optical conductivity in this compounds in terms ofmagnetic/lattice polaron formation.
  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life isvery rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion ofthe founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that theevolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shalldevelop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall showthat if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all availableresources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principleof unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life tosurvive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe isindeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligentlife, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. Ishall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter overantimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.
  We investigate the role of rotational instabilities in the context of blackhole formation in relativistic stars. In addition to the standard scenario - anaxially symmetric dynamical instability forming a horizon at the star's center- the recently found low-$T/|W|$ instabilities are shown to lead tofragmentation and off-center horizon formation in differentially rotatingstars. This process might be an alternative pathway to produce SMBHs fromsupermassive stars with inefficient angular momentum transport.
  Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V. The rational Leray numberL(X) of X is the minimal d such that the rational reduced homology of anyinduced subcomplex of X vanishes in dimensions d and above. Let \pi be asimplicial map from X to a simplex Y, such that the cardinality of the preimageof any point in |Y| is at most r. It is shown that L(\pi(X)) \leq r L(X)+r-1.One consequence is a topological extension of a Helly type result of Amenta.
  We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility ofinterferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence oflow frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobestructure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance isquadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statisticalmethod, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibitsthe same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsiccharacter of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of theimpinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.
  We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of thequasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structureof pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, andelectronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The\pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortexcore induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances thelocal paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutronscattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.
  The confinement problem has been solved in the anisotropic (2+1)-dimensionalSU(N) Yang-Mills theory at weak coupling. In this paper, we find the low-lyingspectrum for N=2. The lightest excitations are pairs of fundamental particlesof the (1+1)-dimensional SU(2)XSU(2) principal chiral sigma model bound in alinear potential, with a specified matching condition where the particlesoverlap. This matching condition can be determined from the exactly-knownS-matrix for the sigma model.
  We study spin S=1 and S=3/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a cubic latticefocusing on spin solid states. Using Schwinger boson formulation for spins, westart in a U(1) spin liquid phase proximate to Neel phase and explore possibleconfining paramagnetic phases as we transition away from the spin liquid by theprocess of monopole condensation. Electromagnetic duality is used to rewritethe theory in terms of monopoles. For spin 1 we find several candidate phasesof which the most natural one is a phase with spins organized into parallelHaldane chains. For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spinsorganized into parallel ladders. As a by-product, we also write a Landau theoryof the ordering in two special classical frustrated XY models on the cubiclattice, one of which is the fully frustrated XY model. In a particular limitour approach maps to a dimer model with 2S dimers coming out of every site, andwe find the same spin solid phases in this regime as well.
  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during abehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as adirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits ismanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to thatcircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficientsof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Thosecoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioraldynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has beenstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms ofexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy inclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy hasbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network andproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may evenbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possibleexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brainhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequentialbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevanceto hemodynamics has been outlined.
  In line with the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al.(Chattaraj, P. K.; Maiti, B.; Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973) anda dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.;Toro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilicdescriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (Wk+) andelectrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capableof simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of thegiven atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along thepath of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptorhas been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions.Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases.Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another relateddescriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) for a nucleophile, overthe electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromaticcompounds.
  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest fornanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs areimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these twotypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will alsohave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order isundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formationbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlationfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order andcorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scalerandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about twodots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, thecorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-criticalfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy andSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering withcorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its naturea stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statisticalanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.
  We discuss the experimental techniques used to date for measuring the changesin polarization state of a laser produced by a strong transverse magnetic fieldacting in a vacuum. We point out the likely artifacts that can arise in suchexperiments, with particular reference to the recent PVLAS observations and theprevious findings of the BFRT collaboration. Our observations are based onstudies with a photon-noise limited coherent homodyne interferometer with apolarization sensitivity of 2x10^-8 rad Hz^(1/2) mW^(-1/2).
  We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, byconsidering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expandinguniverse, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effectsrelated to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected resultthat the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linearorder, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansionparameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in thevacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator andbriefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.
  The HARPS high-resolution high-accuracy spectrograph is offered to theastronomical community since the second half of 2003. Since then, we have beenusing this instrument for monitoring radial velocities of a large sample ofSolar-type stars (~1400 stars) in order to search for their possible low-masscompanions. Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increasethe number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample toimprove our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtainbetter constraints for planet-formation models.  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbitalsolutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. Theradial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1M_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbitalfit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of along-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentricorbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimaltemporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. Wefind clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profilevariations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.
  Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be afinite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mthFrobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. Wededuce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m,the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. Forthe classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the casefor m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.
  We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance inindividual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that varyfour orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path isobtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at varioustemperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurityscattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases withincreasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phononscattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has beenexperimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length atextremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.

  We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence tofinite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamicbehavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlationfunctions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which weformulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspondto the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We providea proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class oftheories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture.Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.
  Since the past Iagrg meeting in December 2004, new developments in loopquantum cosmology have taken place, especially with regards to the resolutionof the Big Bang singularity in the isotropic models. The singularity resolutionissue has been discussed in terms of physical quantities (expectation values ofDirac observables) and there is also an ``improved'' quantization of theHamiltonian constraint. These developments are briefly discussed.  This is an expanded version of the review talk given at the24$^{\mathrm{th}}$ IAGRG meeting in February 2007.

  We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of youngstellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) aredominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGsusing fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra;RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of themicroturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictionsare then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of youngstar clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers.We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.
  A subset $X$ of an abelian $G$ is said to be {\em complete} if every elementof the subgroup generated by $X$ can be expressed as a nonempty sum of distinctelements from $X$.  Let $A\subset \Z_n$ be such that all the elements of $A$ are coprime with$n$. Solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Heilbronn, Olson proved that  $A$ is complete if $n$ is a prime and if $|A|>2\sqrt{n}.$  Recently Vu proved that there is an absolute constant $c$, such that for anarbitrary large $n$, $A$ is complete if $|A|\ge c\sqrt{n},$ and conjecturedthat 2 is essentially the right value of $c$. We show that $A$ is complete if$|A|> 1+2\sqrt{n-4}$, thus proving the last conjecture.
  We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice withnearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik,Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)  This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneouslydimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as thecritical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibitsstrong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of alow-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticledensity. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condenseat the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach,which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, thetransition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near thecritical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regardingthe order of the transition.
  We consider the conditions necessary for obtaining perturbative maximalsupergravity in d dimensions as a decoupling limit of type II superstringtheory compactified on a (10 -- d)-torus. For dimensions d = 2 and d = 3 it ispossible to define a limit in which the only finite-mass states are the 256massless states of maximal supergravity. However, in dimensions d > 3 there areinfinite towers of additional massless and finite-mass states. These correspondto Kaluza--Klein charges, wound strings, Kaluza--Klein monopoles or braneswrapping around cycles of the toroidal extra dimensions. We conclude thatperturbative supergravity cannot be decoupled from string theory in dimensionsd > 3. In particular, we conjecture that pure N = 8 supergravity in fourdimensions is in the Swampland.
  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants intight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to theirpresent orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, wepresent a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. Wefind that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surfacedensity. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate issimply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can beobtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscoustorque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected byadjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time atwhich the planet is released to migrate.
  We report a detection of the 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption feature in adamped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system at z_{abs} = 0.524 toward AO0235+164, using theInfrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The featureshows a broad shallow profile over about 8-12 micrometers in the absorber restframe and appears to be > 15 sigma significant in equivalent width. The featureis fit reasonably well by the silicate absorption profiles for laboratoryamorphous olivine or diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds. To our knowledge,this is the first indication of 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption in a DLA. Wediscuss potential implications of this finding for the nature of the dust inquasar absorbers. Although the feature is relatively shallow (tau_{9.7} =0.08-0.09), it is about 2 times deeper than expected from extrapolation of thetau_{9.7} vs. E(B-V) relation known for diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds.Further studies of the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature in quasar absorbers willopen a new window on the dust in distant galaxies.
  Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlatedoxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions.Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, suchas Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlatedoxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot bethe origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cupratesuperconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), includingthe temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects,the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. Weshow that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, thesearguments are not well founded.
  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglemententropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. Theleading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproducesexactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading termbehaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical forthe entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformalfields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the criticalpoint). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensionalconformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result andis related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.
  Magnetic field effects on the one-dimensional frustrated ferromagnetic chainare studied by means of effective field theory approaches in combination withnumerical calculations utilizing Lanczos diagonalization and the density matrixrenormalization group method. The nature of the ground state is shown to changefrom a spin-density-wave region to a nematic-like one upon approaching thesaturation magnetization. The excitation spectrum is analyzed and the behaviorof the single spin-flip excitation gap is studied in detail, including theemergent finite-size corrections.
  We study fragmentation trees of Gibbs type. In the binary case, we identifythe most general Gibbs-type fragmentation tree with Aldous' beta-splittingmodel, which has an extended parameter range $\beta>-2$ with respect to the${\rm beta}(\beta+1,\beta+1)$ probability distributions on which it is based.In the multifurcating case, we show that Gibbs fragmentation trees areassociated with the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet models for exchangeablerandom partitions of $\mathbb {N}$, with an extended parameter range$0\le\alpha\le1$, $\theta\ge-2\alpha$ and $\alpha<0$, $\theta =-m\alpha$, $m\in\mathbb {N}$.
  Aiming at a better understand of the physical and chemical processes in thehot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed theprototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the SubmillimeterArray (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved thehot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatialresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them locatedwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellardensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allowsus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperaturestructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot coretemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatialdifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhancedat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperaturesensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. TheSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from thishot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hotcore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons forthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the mainsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to thelarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of thecentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data areconsistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot excludethe outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternativecauses of this velocity pattern.
  We investigate the plasma flow properties inside a Supergranular (SG) cell,in particular its interaction with small scale magnetic field structures. TheSG cell has been identified using the magnetic network (CaII wing brightness)as proxy, applying the Two-Level Structure Tracking (TST) to high spatial,spectral and temporal resolution observations obtained by IBIS. The full 3Dvelocity vector field for the SG has been reconstructed at two differentphotospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed themean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied thebehaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial withcluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand theinteraction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features.The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flowfrom its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probablycreated by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. Onthe edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby orcospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knotsof the magnetic network.
  Differential and total cross-sections for photoproduction of gamma proton toproton pi0 omega and gamma proton to Delta+ omega were determined frommeasurements of the CB-ELSA experiment, performed at the electron acceleratorELSA in Bonn. The measurements covered the photon energy range from theproduction threshold up to 3GeV.
  We present the results of a muon-spin relaxation study of the high-Tcanalogue material Cs2AgF4. We find unambiguous evidence for magnetic order,intrinsic to the material, below T_C=13.95(3) K. The ratio of inter- tointraplane coupling is estimated to be |J'/J|=1.9 x 10^-2, while fits of thetemperature dependence of the order parameter reveal a critical exponentbeta=0.292(3), implying an intermediate character between pure two- and three-dimensional magnetism in the critical regime. Above T_C we observe a signalcharacteristic of dipolar interactions due to linear F-mu-F bonds, allowing themuon stopping sites in this compound to be characterized.
  This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimoleculardecomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantumchemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for eachcycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formedhave been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data(\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained bymeans of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also beenincluded. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transitionstate theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rateconstant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products havebeen calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowedto validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that therotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are ofimportance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strainenergies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated andshow that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removedupon the activation process.
  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a largeN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-typegalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitormass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems asa function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies andsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties ofthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halomass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter thatgoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-typegalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, anddoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact thatmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these threetrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massiveearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxiesform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low massearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last majormerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have centralcusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.
  Recently Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averagesover a family of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. Their L-functionsRatios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for manyproblems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers andmoments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showingagreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, andprovide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions RatiosConjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. Wetest a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplecticfamily of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamentaldiscriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculateall the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfectagreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we showagreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for thisfamily and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the RatiosConjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.
  We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector atevery time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinateprocesses at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long rangebehavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasingorder. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, wecharacterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings istight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution givenby independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study oneparticular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particlegets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identicallydistributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such aprocess. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.
  The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion ofheavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-DependentHartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is usedto probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state isexcited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetricsystems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of thefused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation andvibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDRenergy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimentaldata, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We alsoquantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from thepre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may besuitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactivebeams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.
  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMBobservations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present allknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the levelof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes maypresent a challenge to string cosmology.  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observationthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of theHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. Forthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to anextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models aresuperheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications forparticle phenomenology based on string theory.
  This paper deals with the investigation of the solution of an unifiedfractional reaction-diffusion equation associated with the Caputo derivative asthe time-derivative and Riesz-Feller fractional derivative as thespace-derivative. The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace andFourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The resultsderived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier bymany authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamentalsolution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al.(2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of usingRiesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractionalreaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamentalsolution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalizationof neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, andtime-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can beinterpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and areexpressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.
  A review of theoretical and experimental studies of thermal effects insolid-state lasers is presented, with a special focus on diode-pumpedytterbium-doped materials. A large part of this review provides however generalinformation applicable to any kind of solid-state laser. Our aim here is not tomake a list of the techniques that have been used to minimize thermal effects,but instead to give an overview of the theoretical aspects underneath, and givea state-of-the-art of the tools at the disposal of the laser scientist tomeasure thermal effects. After a presentation of some general properties ofYb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map inYb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is thefirst step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).We will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of thethermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations ofthermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a contextwhere it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art ofexperimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V,we will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where theirpeculiarities will be pointed out.
  A new incremental algorithm for data compression is presented. For a sequenceof input symbols algorithm incrementally constructs a p-adic integer number asan output. Decoding process starts with less significant part of a p-adicinteger and incrementally reconstructs a sequence of input symbols. Algorithmis based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic codingalgorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compressiontechnique - arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 thealgorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class ofmodels it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for anotherspecial model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.
  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practicalpossibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity andpermeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singulartransformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloakingin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematicalproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and thepermeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloakedobjects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\"odinger form with theelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove thatthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentiallyself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarilyequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since thecoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that thescattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that theconstruction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive andactive devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we provecloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results provethat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.
  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as theconductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the centralpoint of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits ofeigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found formany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted testfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, allone-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the samedistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correctionterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging fromexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, anddepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of theexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacingsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fouriercoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expectto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (forexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of ellipticcurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower orderbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rankover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze severalfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forcedtorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).
  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedlyused in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamicbehaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positivefeedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of ageneral multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the numberof positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We showanalytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if nis even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including singlelevels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) forparameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from thestandard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most onesteady state.
  Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fullyquantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport inone-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phononinteraction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononictransport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents ofthe coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As anapplication, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctionswithin the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy currentconservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important indetermining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomicjunctions.
  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It hasgenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughputcapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is notachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of "canonicalnetworks", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that thethroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upperbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are manyhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for generalnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upperbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks withrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs farbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near thegateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) tofashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can beimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it isworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.
  In this work initial numbers and repunit numbers have been studied. Allnumbers have been considered in a decimal notation. The problem of simplicityof initial numbers has been studied. Interesting properties of numbers repunitare proved:  $gcd(R_a, R_b) = R_{gcd(a,b)}$;  $R_{ab}/(R_aR_b)$ is an integer only if $gcd(a,b) = 1$, where $a\geq1$,$b\geq1$ are integers. Dividers of numbers repunit, are researched by a degreeof prime number.
  We consider a supersymmetric Bogomolny-type model in 2+1 dimensionsoriginating from twistor string theory. By a gauge fixing this model is reducedto a modified U(n) chiral model with N<=8 supersymmetries in 2+1 dimensions.After a Moyal-type deformation of the model, we employ the dressing method toexplicitly construct multi-soliton configurations on noncommutative R^{2,1} andanalyze some of their properties.
  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangledstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are welldefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at theheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and forapplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,entanglement can be "swapped": if one prepares two independent entangled pairsA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a "Bell-StateMeasurement", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangledstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any commonpast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametricdown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharpsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, thecoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can bereplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowingfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experimentexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in theefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinearcrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach isindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangledphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal ormechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.
  A projective surface S is said to be isogenous to a product if there existtwo smooth curves C, F and a finite group G acting freely on C \times F so thatS=(C \times F)/G. In this paper we classify all surfaces with p_g=q=1 which areisogenous to a product.
  Both BaBar and Belle have found evidence for a non-zero width difference inthe $D^0$-$\bar D^0$ system. Although there is no direct experimental evidencefor CP-violation in $D$ mixing (yet), we show that the measured values of thewidth difference $y\sim \Delta\Gamma$ already imply constraints on theCP-violating phase in $D$ mixing, which, if significantly different from zero,would be an unambiguous signal of new physics.
  A narrow elliptic ring containing an electron threaded by a magnetic field Bis studied. When the ring is highly flattened, the increase of B would lead toa big energy gap between the ground and excited states, and therefore lead to astrong emission of dipole photons. The photon frequency can be tuned in a widerange by changing B and/or the shape of the ellipse. The particle density isfound to oscillate from a pattern of distribution to another pattern back andforth against $B$. This is a new kind of Aharonov-Bohm oscillation originatingfrom symmetry breaking and is different from the usual oscillation ofpersistent current.
  The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray TimingExplorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generallyhave non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this typeof data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting ofdata points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated thatfor Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce thesensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, amodified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, givesimproved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefitsof weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LATobservations of gamma-ray binaries.
  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from thereceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectivelyactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examplesshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is onlyslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matchedfilter can require significantly more feedback.
  The carrier spin coherence in a p-doped GaAs/(Al,Ga)As quantum well with adiluted hole gas has been studied by picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation withan in-plane magnetic field. For resonant optical excitation of the positivelycharged exciton the spin precession shows two types of oscillations. Fastoscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of thecharged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasingtimes up to 650 ps. The spin dephasing time as well as the in-plane hole gfactor show strong temperature dependence, underlining the importance of holelocalization at cryogenic temperatures.
  For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among themost studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-knownformulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despitevarious attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validityof such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problemin the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degenerationtechniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces ofstable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycleof e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We alsoprecisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carryinge-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper westudy the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle onC having prescribed ramification at a given point.
  We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current $\Lambda$CDM universeforward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so thatobservers in our "island universe" will be fundamentally incapable ofdetermining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of thehighly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordialorigin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, thisepoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. Inthis sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhapsfittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universewas first presented.
  An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of thestructural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponenthard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield athermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending theknown analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressionsfor the contact values of the radial distribution functions and thecorresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions ofthis methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres andsquare-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbationtheory of fluids are briefly addressed.
  In some particular cases we give criteria for morphic sequences to be almostperiodic (=uniformly recurrent). Namely, we deal with fixed points ofnon-erasing morphisms and with automatic sequences. In both cases apolynomial-time algorithm solving the problem is found. A result more or lesssupporting the conjecture of decidability of the general problem is given.
  After recalling the conceptual foundations and the basic structure of generalrelativity, we review some of its main modern developments (apart fromcosmology) : (i) the post-Newtonian limit and weak-field tests in the solarsystem, (ii) strong gravitational fields and black holes, (iii) strong-fieldand radiative tests in binary pulsar observations, (iv) gravitational waves,(v) general relativity and quantum theory.
  The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependentHartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-numberconservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinalresponse function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. Asimple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-numberconservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of thecorrelated systems and for the density response function are derived and it isshown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrumhas an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. Thecollective response is studied for a simplified form of the residualinteraction.
  In this paper I describe a specialized algorithm for anisotropic diffusiondetermined by a field of transition rates. The algorithm can be used todescribe some interesting forms of diffusion that occur in the study of protonmotion in a network of hydrogen bonds. The algorithm produces data that requirea nonstandard method of spectral analysis which is also developed here.Finally, I apply the algorithm to a simple specific example.
  This article gives the proof of results announced in [J. Blanc, FiniteAbelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris,S\'er. I 344 (2007), 21-26.] and some description of automorphisms of rationalsurfaces.  Given a finite Abelian subgroup of the Cremona group of the plane, we providea way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group ofautomorphisms of a minimal surface.  In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birationaltransformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of itsnon-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups,there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z,whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which isnot conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface.  We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finiteorder) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.
  A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic forcemicroscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex ofconventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagneticlayer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using thesetips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here wedemonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of themoment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which isproportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Ourmodeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved inthe observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bitdensities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.
  In the last years the traditional scenario of Big Bang has been deeplymodified by the study of the quantum features of the Universe evolution,proposing again the problem of using local physical laws on cosmic scale, withparticular regard to the cosmological constant role. The group extention methodshows that the De Sitter group univocally generalizes the Poincare group,formally justifies the cosmological constant use and suggests a newinterpretation for Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions in Quantum Cosmology.
  Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission models of BL  Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales ofmonths, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cmtelescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength intervalexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration timerender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different statesof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described inthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in theH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in theV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contraryto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights ofNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variabilityepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flarewith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.
  We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete withautomatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout forquantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performancevariance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement.We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithmsuitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-basedanalysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement ofqubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates betterlayouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and schedulingmechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost ofsome area.
  In this series of lectures we first describe the basic ingredients ofgalactic chemical evolution and discuss both analytical and numerical models.Then we compare model results for the Milky Way, Dwarf Irregulars, Quasars andthe Intra-Cluster- Medium with abundances derived from emission lines. Thesecomparisons allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar nucleosynthesisand the mechanisms of galaxy formation.
  We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern inpolymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a singlemicrotubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarlyaligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarizationmicroscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that thepolymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressionalforce. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocitycurve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MTbundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysisimplies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
  We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set ofphotonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible designmethodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized forspecific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several suchGA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in verycomplex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robustdesign tool in present and future applications.
  It has recently been suggested that exchange spring media offer a way toincrease media density without causing thermal instability(superparamagnetism), by using a hard and a soft layer coupled by exchange.Victora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio ofthe energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switchingfield, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approacheshave been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupledStoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we showthat many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases orapproximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energyis minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized interms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in whichboth the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In thisformulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which canbe no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suesset al comes very close to this limit.
  Graphene nano-ribbons junctions based electronic devices are proposed in thisLetter. Non-equilibrium Green function calculations show that nano-ribbonjunctions tailored from single layer graphene with different edge shape andwidth can act as metal-semiconductor junctions and quantum dots can beimplemented. In virtue of the possibilities of patterning monolayer graphenedown to atomic precision, these structures, quite different from the previouslyreported two-dimensional bulk graphene or carbon nanotube devices, are expectedto be used as the building blocks of the future nano-electronics.
  The notion of topological free entropy dimension of $n-$tuples of elements ina unital C$^*$ algebra was introduced by Voiculescu. In the paper, we computetopological free entropy dimension of one self-adjoint element and topologicalorbit dimension of one self-adjoint element in a unital C$^*$ algebra.Moreover, we calculate the values of topological free entropy dimensions offamilies of generators of some unital C$^*$ algebras (for example: irrationalrotation C$^*$ algebras or minimal tensor product of two reduced C$^*$ algebrasof free groups).
  For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved theinequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negativeoperator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. Theseinequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concavefunctions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,and Kosem, respectively.  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|)|||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have asimilar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answerexactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmativelyin the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.  In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominatedmajorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itselfa Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allowsto strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.
  We construct several difference families on cyclic groups of orders 47 and97, and use them to construct skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 188 and 388.Such difference families and matrices are constructed here for the first time.The matrices are constructed by using the Goethals-Seidel array.
  We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in thelow-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bumpfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expectedrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequenceturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from theYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Reginamodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant tomain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discusstheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that theinclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulombinteractions may be partly responsible.  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponentand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The bluestraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB orRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency atlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate thatthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present densitystructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusuallylow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite ofthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on thefrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.
  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum ofelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear thatthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning starswithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their originhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost theirenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarfpopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary populationsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on thebinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hotsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproducesmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range ofobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolutionwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostictools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications forunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies ingeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, ashad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be stronglydependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally fromdwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.
  During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential toanother as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity ofbond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size whichdetermines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potentialinteractions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. Thisproblem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of thesystem for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring bothenergy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for ahysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of thealgorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MDsimulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows withinexperimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the boxshould also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.
  We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as analternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to formmagnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to thesuperlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typicalpolarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectriccomponent is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that arecompatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no activeferroelectric ions.
  Recent investigations have established an analogy between the entropy offour-dimensional supersymmetric black holes in string theory and entanglementin quantum information theory. Examples include: (1) N=2 STU black holes andthe tripartite entanglement of three qubits (2-state systems), where the commonsymmetry is [SL(2)]^3 and (2) N=8 black holes and the tripartite entanglementof seven qubits where the common symmetry is E_7 which contains [SL(2)]^7. Herewe present another example: N=8 black holes (or black strings) in fivedimensions and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits (3-state systems),where the common symmetry is E_6 which contains [SL(3)]^3. Both the black hole(or black string) entropy and the entanglement measure are provided by theCartan cubic E_6 invariant. Similar analogies exist for ``magic'' N=2supergravity black holes in both four and five dimensions.
  Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we havestudied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbonnanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, theatomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressurederivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), aconstant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. Theintrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence ofthe experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMsfrequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h toD2h then to C2h.
  The ``atom diode'' is a laser device that lets the ground state atom pass inone direction but not in the opposite direction. We examine three-dimensionaleffects of that device for arbitrary atomic incidence angles on flat lasersheets and set breakdown limiting angles and velocities. It is found that acorrect diodic behavior independent of the incident angle can be obtained withblue detuned lasers.
  A toroidal trap combined with external time-dependent electric field can beused for implementing different dynamical regimes of matter waves. Inparticular, we show that dynamical and stochastic acceleration, localizationand implementation of the Kapitza pendulum can be originated by means of properchoice of the external force.
  We present a simple proof of the resolvent estimates of elliptic Fouriermultipliers on the Euclidean space, and apply them to the analysis oftime-global and spatially-local smoothing estimates of a class of dispersiveequations. For this purpose we study in detail the properties of therestriction of Fourier transform on the unit cotangent sphere associated withthe symbols of multipliers.
  We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with threesimple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classificationcompletes the classification of fusion categories with three simple objecttypes. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete anduseful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discusspivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementaryre-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic tothe identity.
  We calculate the equation of state of dense hydrogen within the chemicalpicture. Fluid variational theory is generalized for a multi-component systemof molecules, atoms, electrons, and protons. Chemical equilibrium is supposedfor the reactions dissociation and ionization. We identify the region ofthermodynamic instability which is related to the plasma phase transition. Thereflectivity is calculated along the Hugoniot curve and compared withexperimental results. The equation-of-state data is used to calculate thepressure and temperature profiles for the interior of Jupiter.
  We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey ofJupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at theESO-NTT telescope. We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarmand 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published byFornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample ofvisible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate sixfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). Thesample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exceptionof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- andP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with theexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance isdetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-typeasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfertransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojansas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate theproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. Theanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters showsthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. Weperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra propertydistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and incomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higherinclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.
  Distances to well-observed Type II-P SNe are determined from an updatedversion of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM), based on recent theoreticalmodels. The new EPM distances show good agreement with other independentdistances to the host galaxies without any significant systematic bias,contrary to earlier results in the literature. The accuracy of the method iscomparable with that of the distance measurements for Type Ia SNe.
  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations forincompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimalsmoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipateenergy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved forvelocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this spaceis sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of theLittlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled bylocal interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, thestrong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.
  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable forplanetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of theprobability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of thelensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, weconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined asthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to thephotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result fromprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of themagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at whichperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boostoccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probabilitycan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probabilityincreases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability ofevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible evenat magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime targetof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe eventswith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alertedevents. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of thebrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certainmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant starswith magnifications $A\gtrsim 70$.
  We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter spaceof a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform ouranalysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgradedincluding a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that thechannel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameterspace at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that istwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillationis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal forwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from anextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterileneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it issignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further thefour-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by thismass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on$\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possibleexistence of sterile neutrinos.

  Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationallyconnected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied.Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing acovering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the mainresults relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connectedfiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include anextension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classificationtheorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadricfibration.
  We have analytically obtained all the density matrix elements up to sixlattice sites for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain at $\Delta=1/2$. We use themultiple integral formula of the correlation function for the massless XXZchain derived by Jimbo and Miwa. As for the spin-spin correlation functions, wehave newly obtained the fourth- and fifth-neighbour transverse correlationfunctions. We have calculated all the eigenvalues of the density matrix andanalyze the eigenvalue-distribution. Using these results the exact values ofthe entanglement entropy for the reduced density matrix up six lattice siteshave been obtained. We observe that our exact results agree quite well with theasymptotic formula predicted by the conformal field theory.
  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-lightpseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory(\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quarkmass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalarcorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatmentassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing thestaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partiallyquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate seaquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partiallyquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects ofnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governingthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful inanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when thelight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.
  We have performed longitudinal ultrasound (9.5 MHz) attenuation measurementsin the B-phase of superfluid $^3$He in 98% porosity aerogel down to the zerotemperature limit for a wide range of pressures at zero magnetic field. Theabsolute attenuation was determined by direct transmission of sound pulses.Compared to the bulk fluid, our results revealed a drastically differentbehavior in attenuation, which is consistent with theoretical accounts withgapless excitations and a collision drag effect.
  Precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP violation are discussed,pointing out possible signatures for other sources of CP violation and for newflavor-changing operators. The current status of the most accurate tests issummarized.
  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more generalnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to havea fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the "rock-paper-scissor" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.
  Some of the means through which the possible presence of nearly deconfinedquarks in neutron stars can be detected by astrophysical observations ofneutron stars from their birth to old age are highlighted.
  With the anticipated launch of GLAST, the existing X-ray telescopes, and theenhanced capabilities of the new generation of TeV telescopes, developing toolsfor modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becominga high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zonesynchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. Wethen present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, timedelayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, ourcode can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situationtypical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproducevariability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeVflares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.
  We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring inKeplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorptioncoefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence withthe distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculatedposition-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for differentvalues of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emissionat a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner orouter edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the lineof sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similarto the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxyNGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this objectthe absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as adecreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from theinner edge of the ring.
  We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysisand evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storagesystem. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers ofoverlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levelshave been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, anderror detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errorsoc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of thehierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. Themodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment forsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to injectfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection andrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several faultmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, diskfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in thedisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a givensubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of thelower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate andanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanismsimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) theaccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.
  It is shown that in the units of augmentation one of an integral group ring$\mathbb{Z} G$ of a finite group $G$, a noncyclic subgroup of order $p^{2}$,for some odd prime $p$, exists only if such a subgroup exists in $G$. Thecorresponding statement for $p=2$ holds by the Brauer--Suzuki theorem, asrecently observed by W. Kimmerle.
  The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in lasercooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in amagneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of theloading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to asimple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. Wealso study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity onthe position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontaldirections. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation wherecooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.
  We investigate the incremental stability properties of It\^o stochasticdynamical systems. Specifically, we derive a stochastic version of nonlinearcontraction theory that provides a bound on the mean square distance betweenany two trajectories of a stochastically contracting system. This bound can beexpressed as a function of the noise intensity and the contraction rate of thenoise-free system. We illustrate these results in the contexts of stochasticnonlinear observers design and stochastic synchronization.
  It is used the mechanical method of Abrikosov vortex stimulated dynamicsinvestigation in superconductors. With its help it was studied relaxationphenomena in vortex matter of high-temperature superconductors. It establishedthat pulsed magnetic fields change the course of relaxation processes takingplace in vortex matter. The study of the influence of magnetic pulses differingby their durations and amplitudes on vortex system of isotropichigh-temperature superconductors system HoBa2Cu3O7-d showed the presence ofthreshold phenomena. The small duration pulses does not change the course ofrelaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. When the duration of pulsesexceeds some critical value (threshold), then their influence change the courseof relaxation process which is revealed by stepwise change of relaxingmechanical moment . These investigations showed that the time for formatting ofAbrikosov vortex lattice in HoBa2Cu3O7-d is of the order of 20 microsec. whichon the order of value exceeds the time necessary for formation of a singlevortex observed in type II superconductors.
  The kaon electromagnetic (e.m.) form factor is reviewed considering alight-front constituent quark model. In this approach, it is discussed therelevance of the quark-antiquark pair terms for the full covariance of the e.m.current. It is also verified, by considering a QCD dynamical model, that a goodagreement with experimental data can be obtained for the kaon weak decayconstant once a probability of about 80% of the valence component is taken intoaccount.
  We present improved post-Newtonian-inspired initial data for non-spinningblack-hole binaries, suitable for numerical evolution with punctures. Werevisit the work of Tichy et al. [W. Tichy, B. Bruegmann, M. Campanelli, and P.Diener, Phys. Rev. D 67, 064008 (2003)], explicitly calculating the remainingintegral terms. These terms improve accuracy in the far zone and, for the firsttime, include realistic gravitational waves in the initial data. We investigatethe behavior of these data both at the center of mass and in the far zone,demonstrating agreement of the transverse-traceless parts of the new metricwith quadrupole-approximation waveforms. These data can be used for numericalevolutions, enabling a direct connection between the merger waveforms and thepost-Newtonian inspiral waveforms.
  By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariancecharacteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent forthe scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at$\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into leftand right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches areasymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths,respectively.
  These notes, based on the paper "Formal Solution of the Master Equation viaHPT and Deformation Theory" by Huebschmann and Stasheff, were prepared for aseries of talks at Illinois State University with the intention of applyingHomological Perturbation Theory to the derived bracket constructions ofKosmann-Schwarzbach and T. Voronov, and eventually writing Part II of the paper"Higher Derived Brackets and Deformation Theory I" by the present authors.
  We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beamquality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Ramantransition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Ramanoutcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has onthe outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atomlaser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experimentswith tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atomlasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of thecondensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberglimit.
  We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photonswhich does not require cavities. It relies on the collective enhancement oflight emission as a consequence of the presence of entanglement in atomicensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore ourscheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety ofphotonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simplesequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, andparticularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and incells at room temperature.
  Although the rocket-based X-ray Quantum Calorimetry (XQC) experiment wasdesigned for X-ray spectroscopy, the minimal shielding of its calorimeters, itslow atmospheric overburden, and its low-threshold detectors make it among themost sensitive instruments for detecting or constraining strong interactionsbetween dark matter particles and baryons. We use Monte Carlo simulations toobtain the precise limits the XQC experiment places on spin-independentinteractions between dark matter and baryons, improving upon earlier analyticalestimates. We find that the XQC experiment rules out a wide range ofnucleon-scattering cross sections centered around one barn for dark matterparticles with masses between 0.01 and 10^5 GeV. Our analysis also provides newconstraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter stronglyinteracts with baryons.
  Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteenGHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources areselected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others arefrom our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPSsources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying theabsorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources forthe first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicatingthat they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.This result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showingdouble-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Threesources J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as core-jetsources according to their morphologies and flux variability.
  The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of singlephotochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces withclosed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistentnonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory.The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikinglydistinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within awide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmissionpeaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport propertiesof the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage aremainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually bythe perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculatedon-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is abouttwo orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of theexperimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behaviorwithin a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F orS for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.
  An n-homomorphism between algebras is a linear map $\phi : A \to B$ such that$\phi(a_1 ... a_n) = \phi(a_1)... \phi(a_n)$ for all elements $a_1, >..., a_n\in A.$ Every homomorphism is an n-homomorphism, for all n >= 2, but theconverse is false, in general. Hejazian et al. [7] ask: Is every *-preservingn-homomorphism between C*-algebras continuous? We answer their question in theaffirmative, but the even and odd n arguments are surprisingly disjoint. Wethen use these results to prove stronger ones: If n >2 is even, then $\phi$ isjust an ordinary *-homomorphism. If n >= 3 is odd, then $\phi$ is a differenceof two orthogonal *-homomorphisms. Thus, there are no nontrivial *-linearn-homomorphisms between C*-algebras.
  We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. Inthe case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matricesof S. Zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of Abelianand Jordanian types. A part of twists corresponding to the r-matrices ofZakrzewski classification are given in explicit form.
  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hiddenMarkov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis ontwo-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decodesequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical foranalysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) andfor continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performanceof the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on bothsimulated and real DNA sequences.
  We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, underthe effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath ofoscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitablechoice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser.For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result thatfor a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated interms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compareholonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)gates.
  We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effectiveinterfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is adetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensionswithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbsmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning forceand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modifythis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough tobeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will causedelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlapbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction tolocalization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows thatin higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when thepinning force tends to infinity.
  The electromagnetic form factors of the exotic baryons are calculated in theframework of the relativistic quark model at small and intermediate momentumtransfer. The charge radii of the E+++ baryons are determined.
  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on thespin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the tripletof modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numericallythe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with thespin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the modeamplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations isreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo acyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward afull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitationalradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very longtimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered areshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We varyproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperatureT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCAreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain toranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplituderemains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layerviscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active forabout 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in thelocal group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.
  We discuss the possibility to extract the neutron-neutron scattering lengtha_{nn} from experimental spectra on the reaction gamma d --> pi^+ nn. Thetransition operator is calculated to high accuracy from chiral perturbationtheory. We argue that for properly chosen kinematics, the theoreticaluncertainty of the method can be as low as 0.1 fm.
  Evaporation residue and fission cross sections of radioactive $^{132}$Sn on$^{64}$Ni were measured near the Coulomb barrier. A large sub-barrier fusionenhancement was observed. Coupled-channel calculations including inelasticexcitation of the projectile and target, and neutron transfer are in goodagreement with the measured fusion excitation function. When the change innuclear size and shift in barrier height are accounted for, there is no extrafusion enhancement in $^{132}$Sn+$^{64}$Ni with respect to stable Sn+$^{64}$Ni.A systematic comparison of evaporation residue cross sections for the fusion ofeven $^{112-124}$Sn and $^{132}$Sn with $^{64}$Ni is presented.
  S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications ofactive star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. Wepresent mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring theevolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum andspectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cmwater maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 isclearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mmcontinuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which aredominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates forthese cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII regionand exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a younghot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain furthermultiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2Omaser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dustcores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. Thedominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that tracesthe surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground materialon its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to thenortheast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likelytraces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide directevidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.
  Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4,433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect ofstochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization oftransmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Muellertransformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It isobserved that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positiveoperator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. Thisobservation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne(Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantummeasurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elementscan be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a wayof realizing different types of Mueller devices.
  This work contains the teleparallel version of the stationary axisymmetricsolutions. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields representing thesesolutions. The tensor, vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion tensor areevaluated. It is found that the axial-vector has component only along $\rho$and $z$ directions. The three possibilities of the axial vector depending onthe metric function $B$ are discussed. The vector related with spin has alsobeen evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further,we use the teleparallel version of M$\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find theenergy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that(for $\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory areequal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity ineach, which may become equal under certain conditions. Finally, we discuss thetwo special cases of the stationary axisymmetric solutions.
  Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr\"olicher spaces by weakeningthe analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions tobe more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relatesmooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion ofsmooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result thata closed Fr\"olicher subspace $A$ of the Fr\"olicher space $X$ is a smoothneighborhood deformation retract of $X$ if and only if the inclusion $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As anapplication we construct the right Puppe sequence.
  A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described,allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states andproviding a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explainingteleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are firstexplained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphicaldescription, out of which teleportation arises naturally.
  We investigate the possibility of electroweak phase transition in the minimalsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with an extra $U(1)'$. This model has twoHiggs doublets and a singlet, in addition to a singlet exotic quark superfield.We find that at the one-loop level this model may accommodate the electroweakphase transitions that are strongly first-order in a reasonably large region ofthe parameter space. In the parameter region where the phase transitions takeplace, we observe that the lightest scalar Higgs boson has a smaller mass whenthe strength of the phase transition becomes weaker. Also, the other threeheavier neutral Higgs bosons get more large masses when the strength of thephase transition becomes weaker.
  The past two Decadal Surveys in Astronomy and Astrophysics recommended thecompletion of a space-based interferometry mission, known today as SIMPlanetQuest, for its unique ability to detect and characterize nearby rockyplanets (Bahcall 1991, McKee & Taylor 2001), as well as contributions to abroad range of problems in astrophysics. Numerous committees of the NationalResearch Council as well as NASA Roadmaps have similarly highlighted SIM as theone technology that offers detection and characterization of rocky planetsaround nearby stars and which is technically ready. To date, SIM remains theonly program with the capability of detecting and confirming rocky planets inthe habitable zones of nearby solar-type stars. Moreover, SIM measures massesand three-dimensional orbits of habitable planets around nearby stars (within25 pc); these are the only stars for which follow-up by other techniques isfeasible, such as space-based spectroscopy, ground-based interferometry, and ofcourse TPF.
  The exhaustive study of the rigid symmetries of arbitrary free field theoriesis motivated, along several lines, as a preliminary step in the completion ofthe higher-spin interaction problem in full generality. Some results for thesimplest example (a scalar field) are reviewed and commented along these lines.
  We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and itslow-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature thephotoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisationsat high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer ofspectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectralfunction for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental featureswith very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonicinsulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.
  We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay tophotons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of photon+jet+missing transverseenergy events in p-pbar collisions at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF IIdetector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photonat the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570 pb-1 of collision data,we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3+-0.7events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, weset cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with\tilde{\chi}_1^0->\gamma\gravitino and place the world-best 95% C.L. lowerlimit on the \tilde{\chi}_1^0 mass of 101 GeV/c^2 at \tau_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} =5 ns.
  When charged particles collide with a vacuum bubble, they can radiate strongelectromagnetic waves due to rapid deceleration. Owing to the energy loss ofthe particles by this bremsstrahlung radiation, there is a non-negligibledamping pressure acting on the bubble wall even when thermal equilibrium ismaintained. In the non-relativistic region, this pressure is proportional tothe velocity of the wall and could have influenced the bubble dynamics in theearly universe.
  In the reaction e+e- -> WW -> (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usualhadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 comingfrom two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons maycoexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systemsmay be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effectis known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of theinvestigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of Wpairs in DELPHI at LEP are presented. Two complementary analyses wereperformed, studying the particle flow between jets and W mass estimators, withnegligible correlation between them, and the results were combined and comparedto models. In the framework of the SK-I model, the value for its kappaparameter most compatible with the data was found to be: kappa_{SK-I} =2.2^{+2.5}_{-1.3} corresponding to the probability of reconnection P_{reco} tobe in the range 0.31 < P_{reco} < 0.68 at 68% confidence level with its bestvalue at 0.52.
  An critical overview of the current state of research in turbulence inastrophysical disks.
  We study how to incorporate CP violation in the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN)mechanism. To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with aflavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is foundthat at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetryare necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relativephase between their vacuum expectation values.  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and theCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase aredetermined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectationvalues R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how theangles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonalelements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| are predicted as a function of |V_{us}|, |R| and\alpha. Although the predicted value of the CP violating phase does not agreewith the experimental data within the simplest model, the basic idea of ourscenario would be promising to construct a more realistic model of flavor andCP violation.
  We study finite-temperature phase transitions in a two-dimensional bosonHubbard model with zero-point quantum fluctuations via Monte Carlo simulationsof quantum rotor model, and construct the corresponding phase diagram.Compressibility shows a thermally activated gapped behavior in the insulatingregime. Finite-size scaling of the superfluid stiffness clearly shows thenature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The transition temperature,$T_c$, confirms a scaling relation $T_c \propto \rho_0^x$ with $x=1.0$. Someevidences of anomalous quantum behavior at low temperatures are presented.
  The spectral action on noncommutative torus is obtained, using aChamseddine--Connes formula via computations of zeta functions. The importanceof a Diophantine condition is outlined. Several results on holomorphiccontinuation of series of holomorphic functions are obtained in this context.
  AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniforminterstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagatingthrough a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic fieldstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection ofrelativistic electrons.  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight isnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient ofambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify thedegree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic ofthe microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between modelsand observations.  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can beexplained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magneticfield strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with convergingsimilar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.
  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extendedcolor distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. Thisphenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhancedsecond generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that thesepeculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs withextended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated byrandom motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the innerhalo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to theformation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematicproperties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretionorigin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and weanticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations ofMilky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.
  We investigate the formation of collisionless shocks along the spatialprofile of a gaussian laser beam propagating in nonlocal nonlinear media. Fordefocusing nonlinearity the shock survives the smoothing effect of the nonlocalresponse, though its dynamics is qualitatively affected by the latter, whereasfor focusing nonlinearity it dominates over filamentation. The patternsobserved in a thermal defocusing medium are interpreted in the framework of ourtheory.
  Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer freeenergies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibriumtrajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expressiondW/dt=\partial H(x,t)/ \partial t which connects the microscopic work Wperformed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the correspondingHamiltonian H(x,t) at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal asit is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss theimplications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomisticmolecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome theselimitations.
  We extend the theory of separately holomorphic mappings between complexanalytic spaces. Our method is based on Poletsky theory of discs, Rosay Theoremon holomorphic discs and our recent joint-work with Pflug on cross theorems indimension 1. It also relies on our new technique of conformal mappings and ageneralization of Siciak's relative extremal function.  Our approach illustrates the unified character: ``From local informations toglobal extensions". Moreover, it avoids systematically the use of the classicalmethod of doubly orthogonal bases of Bergman type.
  We rigorously derive a weak form of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation asthe homogenization limit of a Stefan-type problem describingreaction-controlled coarsening of a large number of small spherical particles.Moreover, we deduce that the effective mean-field description holds true in theparticular limit of vanishing surface-area density of particles.
  We present an algorithm that produces the classification list of smooth Fanod-polytopes for any given d. The input of the algorithm is a single number,namely the positive integer d. The algorithm has been used to classify smoothFano d-polytopes for d<=7. There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes.
  We study the real-time domain-wall dynamics near a quantum critical point ofthe one-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain. By numericalsimulation, we find the domain wall is dynamically stable in theHeisenberg-Ising model. Near the quantum critical point, the width of thedomain wall diverges as $(\Delta -1) ^{-1/2}$.
  We study characteristics of superpositions and entanglement of thermal statesat high temperatures and discuss their applications to quantum informationprocessing. We introduce thermal-state qubits and thermal-Bell states, whichare a generalization of pure-state qubits and Bell states to thermal mixtures.A scheme is then presented to discriminate between the four thermal-Bell stateswithout photon number resolving detection but with Kerr nonlinear interactionsand two single-photon detectors. This enables one to perform quantumteleportation and gate operations for quantum computation with thermal-statequbits.
  We perform a systematic study of the impact of the J^2 tensor term in theSkyrme energy functional on properties of spherical nuclei. In the Skyrmeenergy functional, the tensor terms originate both from zero-range central andtensor forces. We build a set of 36 parameterizations, which covers a widerange of the parameter space of the isoscalar and isovector tensor termcoupling constants, with a fit protocol very similar to that of the successfulSLy parameterizations. We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a largevariety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as thespin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, theevolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, massresiduals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii. Our mainconclusion is that the currently used central and spin-orbit parts of theSkyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to allow for thepresence of large tensor terms.
  Yang's theorem forbids the process $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ in any Poincar\'{e}invariant theory if photons are bosons and their two-particle states transformunder the Poincar\'{e} group in the standard way (under the standard coproductof the Poincar\'{e} group). This is an important result as it does not dependon the assumptions of quantum field theory. Recent work on noncommutativegeometry requires deforming the above coproduct by the Drinfel'd twist. Weprove that $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. Asan illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0\to \nu + \nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of thePoincar\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is notconserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particleof spin $j$ cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the samehelicity if $j$ is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.
  We discuss the implementation of electric-magnetic duality transformations infour-dimensional gravity linearized around Minkowski or (A)dS4 backgrounds. Inthe presence of a cosmological constant duality generically modifies theHamiltonian, nevertheless the bulk dynamics is unchanged. We pay particularattention to the boundary terms generated by the duality transformations anddiscuss their implications for holography.
  During the epoch of reionization, the formation of radiation sources isaccompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate theimpact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in thefirst galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II andPop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces theformation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x isthe mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photonsthat escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity andk_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, theprimordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.
  Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional,diffusion equation by replacing either the first time derivative or the secondspace derivative by a derivative of fractional order. The fundamental solutionsof these equations provide probability density functions, evolving on time orvariable in space, which are related to the class of stable distributions. Thisproperty is a noteworthy generalization of what happens for the standarddiffusion equation and can be relevant in treating financial and economicalproblems where the stable probability distributions play a key role.
  We study the notion of Fagnano orbits for dual polygonal billiards. We usedthem to characterize regular polygons and we study the iteration of thedeveloping map.
  Coulomb interaction turns anyonic quasiparticles of a primary quantum Hallliquid with filling factor $\nu =1/(2m+1)$ into hard-core anyons. We havedeveloped a model of coherent transport of such quasiparticles in systems ofmultiple antidots by extending the Wigner-Jordan description of 1D abeliananyons to tunneling problems. We show that the anyonic exchange statisticsmanifests itself in tunneling conductance even in the {\em absence} ofquasiparticle exchanges. In particular, it can be seen as a non-vanishingresonant peak associated with quasiparticle tunneling through a line of threeantidots.
  The spin-lattice relaxation time, $T_{1}$, of conduction electrons ismeasured as a function of temperature and magnetic field in MgB$_2$. The methodis based on the detection of the $z$ component of the conduction electronmagnetization under electron spin resonance conditions with amplitude modulatedmicrowave excitation. Measurement of $T_{1}$ below $T_c$ at 0.32 T allows todisentangle contributions from the two Fermi surfaces of MgB$_{2}$ as thisfield restores normal state on the Fermi surface part with $\pi$ symmetry only.
  We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts.Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries toinvestigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronicstates. We find that the Al 3pz states are very sensitive against modificationsof the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transportproperties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy,leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacialrestriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the chargeneutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by meansof quantitative results for the charge transfer.
  The Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton Gamma-RayObservatory (CGRO) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazarsduring its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRETarchives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times andwere bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-lawmodels. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lacobjects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectralindex with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence forspectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes infive blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectraldependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. Weobserved a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales inall three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks wereavailable. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite thewidely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior inthe context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsiblefor emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymapsthat were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.
  In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general modelfor genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who wasable to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of randomnetworks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as inthe disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture onlyfor networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for theBoolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitraryconnectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turnsout that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to theexpectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to constructthe network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of theaverage sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biasedfunctions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when onlyfunctions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.
  We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphicquantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effectsare not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theoryinstantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or theprepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermioniczero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. Theyare crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theoryinstantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. Weanalyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allowfor new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of theeffective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runawaydirections.
  We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylorexpansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs).In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients ofthe expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to dealwith the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrastto other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtaineasily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present aneasily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models,which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examplesunderline the results.
  We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)onboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all fourobserved IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiativeSNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infraredwaveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that theinfrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possiblecontributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-agedSNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Ourresults highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs,especially for diagnosing SNR shocks.
  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsingbinary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarfsecondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, withan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrategenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-linedbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of thelight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a uniqueline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, weassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotationhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed linebroadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primaryradius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads tothe radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and thesemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield theindividual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04\pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoreticalmass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results fromdouble-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunityto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.
  A physical law is represented by the probability distribution of a measuredvariable. The probability density is described by measured data using anestimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. The experimentalinformation and data redundancy are defined in terms of information entropy.The model cost function, comprised of data redundancy and estimation error, isminimized by the creation-annihilation process.
  We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonicquantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on theHilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a referenceGaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measureand exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- andmulti-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzedfor quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss andde-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easilycomputable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define acorresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.
  A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We showthat a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tilinglayer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins toform on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resultingin a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defectonly on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an idealquasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D,contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.
  We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundancesderived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines(CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of theinterstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario,the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confinedwithin the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Onlyafter the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts coolingdown and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of thesemetal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the nextgenerations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets giverise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observedORL-CEL discrepancy. (The full version of this work is submitted to Astronomyand Astrophysics.)
  Quantum enhancement of optical pulse timing accuracy is investigated in theHeisenberg picture. Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, andKerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studiedvia Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impactof decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control forbeating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902(2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that anappreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite anincrease in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherenceeffect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timinginformation is also studied, in order to identify situations in which theenhancement is able to survive.
  We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutronstar (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, wethen derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds forboth relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including importantmulti-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we arguethat proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods producerelativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities,timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable forproducing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded starcluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/Iprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources afteraccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer censusof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatiallywith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster arounda B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster peripheryabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We findthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with thatrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar populationindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show thatthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by itssmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. Whileit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result ofdynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findingssupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smallersub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that thesupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud shouldnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.
  This is a final step in a local classification of pseudo-Riemannian manifoldswith parallel Weyl tensor that are not conformally flat or locally symmetric.
  We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions(NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a futuregalactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrinopropagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, payingspecial attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, whichmay take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibilityof detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either throughmodulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shockwaves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electronfraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possibledetectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonantconversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and forvery small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.
  We study the processes $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$,$K^+K^-\pi^0\pi^0\gamma$ and $K^+ K^- K^+ K^-\gamma$, where the photon isradiated from the initial state. About 34600, 4400 and 2300 fully reconstructedevents, respectively, are selected from 232 \invfb of \babar data. Theinvariant mass of the hadronic final state defines the effective \epemcenter-of-mass energy, so that the $K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ data can becompared with direct measurements of the $e^+ e^-\to K^+K^- \pipi$ reaction; nodirect measurements exist for the $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^0\pi^0$ or $\epem\toK^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ reactions. Studying the structure of these events, we findcontributions from a number of intermediate states, and we extract their crosssections where possible. In particular, we isolate the contribution from $e^+e^-\to\phi(1020) f_{0}(980)$ and study its structure near threshold. In thecharmonium region, we observe the $J/\psi$ in all three final states andseveral intermediate states, as well as the $\psi(2S)$ in some modes, andmeasure the corresponding branching fractions. We see no signal for the Y(4260)and obtain an upper limit of$\BR_{Y(4260)\to\phi\pi^+\pi^-}\cdot\Gamma^{Y}_{ee}<0.4 \ev$ at 90% C.L.
  We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA)observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058,providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout theentire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing pictureof the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions rangebetween 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or thegaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but thisglobal trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolvedregions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is muchsteeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gasmotions.
  In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description ofthe Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.
  We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in atwo-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with twoelectrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean fieldtheory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strongcouplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the locationof phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchangecoupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drivethe system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbitalsusceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can inducean orbital selective Mott state.
  Based on the finite $U$ slave boson method, we have investigated the effectof Rashba spin-orbit(SO) coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents inmesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effectwill decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in thisside-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, thepersistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SOcoupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abruptjumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spincurrent circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in thissystem.
  Motivated by the very recent measurement of the branching ratio of ${B_d^0}\to J/\psi \eta$ decay, we calculate the branching ratios of ${B_d}^0 \toJ/\psi \eta$ and ${B_d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta'$ decays in the perturbative QCD(pQCD) approach. The pQCD predictions for the branching ratios of considereddecays are: $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta) = (1.96 ^{+9.68}_{-0.65}) \times10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the first experimental measurement withinerrors; while $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta') = (1.09 ^{+3.76}_{-0.25}) \times10^{-6}$, very similar with $B_d^0 \to \jpsi \eta$ decay and can be tested bythe forthcoming LHC experiments. The measurements of these decay channels mayhelp us to understand the QCD dynamics in the corresponding energy scale,especially the reliability of pQCD approach to these kinds of B meson decays.
  This is a reply report to astro-ph/0604264. We studied heavy elementproduction in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph/0507439.However it is claimed in astro-ph/0604264 that small scale but high baryondensity region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or inorder not to contradict to observations high density region must be so smallthat it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance.  In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density regionand show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enoughamount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light elementobservations.
  We give a new procedure in Maple for finding the k-th power of a martix. Thealgorithm is based on the article [1].
  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacyobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a setof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from theextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discussthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 suchobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. Anadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identifiedfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets ofresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties withthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modelingof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extendsdown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matchesbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSOpopulation and our Spitzer data set.
  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity arecompared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with anoutgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed usingdifferent boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solutionobtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For eachboundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations andextracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. Thesetests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einsteinequations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system arereviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom ispresented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing theincoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and theconstraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Ratherdifferent approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatialcompactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found herecombines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze theNewman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.
  This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback techniquetowards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables theforwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to thedestination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such asthe feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage ofthe proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in adistributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match thatof centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposedmethod. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughputgains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.
  For k a field of arbitrary characteristic, and R a k-algebra, we show thatthe PI degree of an iterated skew polynomial ringR[x_1;\tau_1,\delta_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n,\delta_n] agrees with the PI degree ofR[x_1;\tau_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n] when each (\tau_i,\delta_i) satisfies a q_i-skewrelation for q_i \in k^{\times} and extends to a higher q_i-skew\tau_i-derivation. We confirm the quantum Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture forvarious quantized coordinate rings, and calculate their PI degrees. We extendthese results to completely prime factor algebras.
  Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varietiesin the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varietiesin the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing therecursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In thecase when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal ofthe model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied bygraph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous withrespect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classicalconstructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of theGrassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.
  In this paper we show that the quotient Aubry set associated to certainLagrangians is totally disconnected (i.e., every connected component consistsof a single point). Moreover, we discuss the relation between this problem anda Morse-Sard type property for (difference of) critical subsolutions ofHamilton-Jacobi equations.
  We analyze the properties of the quasiparticle excitations of metallicantiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study isbased on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensionalHubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistentsolutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numericalrenormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is thenanalyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for thesequasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, andalso from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are foundto be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bfk$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticlepicture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the totalelectron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.
  We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala 25-m telescopein the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \htco. The observed region includesthe  S140 H${\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption againstthe cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warmmolecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$COand CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significantdifferences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearlycoincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption isclearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue thatthese differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas thanthe H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easilyphotodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gaslocated immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.
  In this paper we study the Metropolis algorithm in connection with twomean--field spin systems, the so called mean--field Ising model and theBlume--Emery--Griffiths model. In both this examples the naive choice ofproposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolischain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in thedimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in theproposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational costsimilar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, witha suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gapwhich decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of theenergy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy levelof the starting state.
  One of the most surprising discoveries of extrasolar planets is the detectionof planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets inthe two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefrontquestions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of theexistence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. Thediverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonderto what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied tobinaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of thedetection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies inbinary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with therecent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection ofmore planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on thehorizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial andhabitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamentalinsights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategicimpact on NASA science and missions.
  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ispresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. Allnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well asall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid atnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space isspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement isdemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made formore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown fordistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large HadronCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgsboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showingthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judiciousselection of events.
  We explore the cosmological content of Salam-Sezgin six dimensionalsupergravity, and find a solution to the field equations in qualitativeagreement with observation of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesisabundances, and recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Thecarrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessencefield slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model isa second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of colddark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of thequintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in thismanner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numericalstudy reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total colddark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitterenergy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking ofsupersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structureconstant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)the long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of aRobertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally,we present a String theory background by lifting our six dimensionalcosmological solution to ten dimensions.
  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differentialequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smoothfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transportalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Liegroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the correspondingLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to thestochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back tothe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies inthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after theirdeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integrationschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlyingordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by atruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie groupintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinarydifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods areuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigidbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed bytwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.
  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in ascratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hithertounknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explainingthe phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 muchmore seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevantcalculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likelydate from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historicalinterpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of NovaGeminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant contextand motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his firstmeeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We alsocomment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitationallensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps inhis path towards general relativity.
  The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigrationconditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If theelectromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, andstep-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find thatsignificant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-widthcorrelation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent uponthe three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of anelectromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlationfunction evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior isconfirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the stepdynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration forceacting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis ofthe statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriatetime-scale.
  We report on some recent results concerning the dynamics of Bose-Einsteincondensates, obtained in a series of joint papers with L. Erdos and H.-T. Yau.Starting from many body quantum dynamics, we present a rigorous derivation of acubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation known as the Gross-Pitaevskii equationfor the time evolution of the condensate wave function.
  In this paper we give a definition of "algorithm," "finite algorithm,""equivalent algorithms," and what it means for a single algorithm to dominate aset of algorithms. We define a derived algorithm which may have a smaller meanexecution time than any of its component algorithms. We give an explicitexpression for the mean execution time (when it exists) of the derivedalgorithm. We give several illustrative examples of derived algorithms with twocomponent algorithms. We include mean execution time solutions fortwo-algorithm processors whose joint density of execution times are of severalgeneral forms. For the case in which the joint density for a two-algorithmprocessor is a step function, we give a maximum-likelihood estimation schemewith which to analyze empirical processing time data.
  An LRS Bianchi type-V cosmological models representing a viscous fluiddistribution with a time dependent cosmological term $\Lambda$ is investigated.To get a determinate solution, the viscosity coefficient of bulk viscous fluidis assumed to be a power function of mass density. It turns out that thecosmological term $\Lambda(t)$ is a decreasing function of time, which isconsistent with recent observations of type Ia supernovae. Various physical andkinematic features of these models have also been explored.
  We present results on two-particle angular correlations in proton-protoncollisions at center of mass energies of 200 and 410 GeV. The PHOBOS experimentat the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has a uniquely large coverage forcharged particles, giving the opportunity to explore the correlations at bothshort- and long-range scales. At both energies, a complex two-dimensionalcorrelation structure in $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$ is observed. In thecontext of an independent cluster model of short-range correlations, thecluster size and its decay width are extracted from the two-particlepseudorapidity correlation function and compared with previous measurements inproton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions, as well as PYTHIA and HIJINGpredictions.
  The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying butextremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. Themotivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility thatsuch kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysicalobjects.
  We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using asregulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in allodd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of themoduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem ineven-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Lettercan be applied to this index problem.
  The first-order eikonal approximation is frequently adopted in interpretingthe results of $A(e,e'p)$ measurements. Glauber calculations, for example,typically adopt the first-order eikonal approximation. We present an extensionof the relativistic eikonal approach to $A(e,e'p)$ which accounts forsecond-order eikonal corrections. The numerical calculations are performedwithin the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nucleartransparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonalcorrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The sameapplies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differentialcross sections at low missing momenta. At high missing momenta, however, thesecond-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations incloser agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adoptingpartial-wave expansions.
  We studied in detail the optical spectrum of the post-AGB star HD56126(IRAS07134+1005). We use high resolution spectra (R=25000 and 60000) obtainedwith the echelle spectrographs of the 6-m telescope. About one and a halfthousand absorptions of neutral atoms and ions, absorption bands of C_2, CN,and CH molecules, and interstellar bands (DIBs) are identified in the 4010 to8790 AA wavelength region, and the depths and radial velocities of thesespectral features are measured. Differences are revealed between the variationsof the radial velocities measured from spectral features of differentexcitation. In addition to the well-known variability of the Halpha profile, wefound variations in the profiles of a number of FeII, YII, and BaII lines. Wealso produce an atlas of the spectrum of HD56126 and its comparison staralphaPer. The full version of the atlas is available in electronic form fromWeb-address: http://www.sao.ru/hq/ssl/Atlas/Atlas.html
  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networkshas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of thesenetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a moredetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type ofnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and proposean evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on networkstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, networkstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution ofthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as theintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivialdisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result ofnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deletingintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing networkso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-worldeffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clusteringcoefficient in a network.
  Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with magnetic field ofbarotropic perfect fluid distribution through the techniques used by Latelierand Stachel, is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe,it is assumed that the universe is filled with barotropic perfect fluiddistribution. The magnetic field is due to electric current produced alongx-axis with infinite electrical conductivity. The behaviour of the model inpresence and absence of magnetic field together with other physical aspects isfurther discussed.
  Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energywith negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key tounderstanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave likebubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to thebackground cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on thematter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h),we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids maybe a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss theparameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.
  IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-rayBinaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL dataand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodicoutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target ofOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the sourcebehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. Thesource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4thFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposureof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from aSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbedpower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peakluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance ofthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for anoutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almostquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previouslythought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only thebrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothlyincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbitwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneousaccretion.
  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router linksmakes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order tokeep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred bythe collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluatingflow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly allcases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on aper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on thecollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significantfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relativeaccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage ofsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to theoriginal traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of theimpact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used inNetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of lossof monitoring detail.
  We are proposing to test experimentally the new idea of Enhanced OpticalCooling (EOC) in an electron storage ring. This experiment will confirm newfundamental processes in beam physics and will demonstrate new uniquepossibilities with this cooling technique. It will open important applicationsof EOC in nuclear physics, elementary particle physics and in Light Sources(LS) based on high brightness electron and ion beams.
  We give an easy counter-example to Problem 7.20 from C. Villani's book onmass transport: in general, the quadratic Wasserstein distance between $n$-foldnormalized convolutions of two given measures fails to decrease monotonically.
  The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization ofweighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters,namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient.Although the degree distribution and the average path length admitstraightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient severaldifferent definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined thedifferent definitions and identified the similarities and differences betweenthem. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of theweighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights ofthe connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation normof the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This studyrevealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relativeperturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weightedgraphs.
  The thermodynamics of nucleic acid processes is heavily affected by theelectric double-layer of micro-ions around the polyions. We focus here on theCoulombic contribution to the salt-polyelectrolyte preferential interaction(Donnan) coefficient and we report extremely accurate analytical expressionsvalid in the range of low salt concentration (when polyion radius is smallerthan the Debye length). The analysis is performed at Poisson-Boltzmann level,in cylindrical geometry, with emphasis on highly charged poly-ions (beyond``counter-ion condensation''). The results hold for any electrolyte of the form$z_-$:$z_+$. We also obtain a remarkably accurate expression for the electricpotential in the vicinity of the poly-ion.
  We review the algebraic construction of the S-matrix of AdS/CFT. We alsopresent its symmetry algebra which turns out to be a Yangian of the centrallyextended su(2|2) superalgebra.
  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmicrays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along theextensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, thelight signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not onlyattenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background componentdue to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correctionrequires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosolphase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a givendirection. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phasefunction is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view ofthe fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the imageof the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes thedesign, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of theAPF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamentalproperties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-raybinary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base ourwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they providedhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliablymodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is thedetermination of the so-called "color correction factor", which is oftenempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrumfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot bepre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretionrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earliersuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling thedisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra canbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the colorcorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectrawith other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which isdominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted bystate-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.
